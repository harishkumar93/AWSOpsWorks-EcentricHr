We ourselves are currently investigating our audience. We asked our newsletter readers to fill out a questionnaire. After we have collected the results of our survey, I started analyzing the results. It has been a great week for me! In this post, I would like to present some of our results and try to translate it to some practical tips for you all to use.</p>\n<h2>What did we want to know?</h2>\n<p>Our audience has grown rapidly during the last few years. Yoast began as a WordPress blog, but is currently much more than just a blog. Few years ago Joost was writing and working alone in a small room in our house, while we currently have a nice office and over 10 employees. That made me wonder: who is our audience nowadays? Do we still appeal to a technical (nerdy) group of people? Are our customers mainly developers? Or is not all of our audience that technically skilled? And which products appeal to our audiences?</p>\n<p>My first analysis of our audience focused on whether or not there exist different groups within our audience. My hypotheses was that we would at least have two types of visitors on Yoast.com: a technical ‘nerdy’ group and a less technically skilled group. The aim of my analysis was to investigate whether or not these different groups (intend) to buy different products.</p>\n<h2>How did we do our audience analysis?</h2>\n<p>We collected the data for our audience analysis via an online survey for which we invited all of our newsletter readers to participate. Our final sample consists of 2796 individuals. We asked all kinds of questions, including age and sex, intentions to buy our products and questions about the extent to which individuals liked Yoast. We also measured the level of experience with internet and WordPress by asking people to grade the extent to which they agreed to the following statements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have a high level of knowledge about WordPress;</li>\n<li>I am an experienced WordPress User;</li>\n<li>I am a skilled Web Developer and I am capable of maintaining my own website.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A total of the scores on these statements was calculated (resulting in a range from 4 through 16). As people score higher on this scale (or nerdiness as we like to call it) they’re more experienced. This measurement of experience is important in our analyses, because it is one of the variables on which we assume groups within our audience to differ.</p>\n<table>\n<caption>Table 1: descriptive statistics of the four identified groups (N=2796)</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"empty\" width=\"52%\"></td>\n<th width=\"12%\">mean internet experience</th>\n<th width=\"12%\">mean age</th>\n<th width=\"12%\">% women</th>\n<th width=\"12%\">N</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>group 1 : the women</th>\n<td>11,4</td>\n<td>45,9</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>600</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>group 2: the nerds</th>\n<td>14,6</td>\n<td>36,0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>666</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>group 3: the young, male, non-nerds</th>\n<td>10,5</td>\n<td>32,6</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>615</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>group 4: the old, male, non -nerds</th>\n<td>11,1</td>\n<td>54,1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>910</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<aside id=\"aside\"><h4>Simple alternative to a cluster analysis</h4></p>\n<p>I can imagine that most of you do not consider it fun to figure out the complicated statistics of a cluster analysis. Although our solutions are in fact very elegant, it remains a random grouping. A cluster analysis is just one way to identify groups, and you could just as well use another (more simple) method. Dividing groups on the base of sex, education, age or experience could well do the trick. Decide which variable is most important to differentiate your groups upon (in our case, this would have been internet experience). Then create a number of groups on the base of the scores on this variable.</p>\n<p></aside>\n<p>After computing the scale of experience, we executed a so-called cluster analysis. This is hardcore statistics indeed. You can try this at home using SPSS (expensive, but nice) or R (open source, and nice). A cluster analysis results in the identification of a number of different groups of individuals who display similar scores on the variables of your choice. We identified four groups based on sex, age and the level of experience.</p>\n<p>Table 1 shows that the four groups score differently on variables used in this cluster analysis.</p>\n<p>Our first group consists of women, with an (for our sample) average level of internet experience. The second group consists of men with a very high score on internet experience. We will call them the nerds. Then the cluster analysis revealed two other groups, both containing solely men. One group contains young men with a relatively low level of internet experience and the last group contains older men with an average level of internet experience.</p>\n<h2>What did we find out?</h2>\n<p>On the base of sex, age and experience, we can differentiate between four distinct groups within our total audience. Interesting. But quite useless as well. We have to investigate a bit more. Do these different audiences also buy different products?</p>\n<table>\n<caption>Table 2: % individuals intending to buy Yoast products (N=2796)</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"empty\" width=\"50%\"></td>\n<th width=\"10%\">WP SEO Premium</th>\n<th width=\"10%\">Video SEO</th>\n<th width=\"10%\">Local SEO</th>\n<th width=\"10%\">Theme</th>\n<th width=\"10%\">Website review</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>group 1 : the women</th>\n<td>37</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>group 2: the nerds</th>\n<td>50</td>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>26</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>14</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>group 3: the young, male, non-nerds</th>\n<td>43</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>21</td>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>19</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>group 4: the old, male, non -nerds</th>\n<td>39</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>12</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<aside id=\"aside\"><h4>Analyzing intended shopping behavior yourself</h4></p>\n<p>If you want to study whether different groups have different shopping intentions, you should add a question about intended shopping to your questionnaire.

Percentages make it possible to compare between groups (even if group sizes differ). Making a table like table 2 in this post will create a clear overview of your results.</p>\n<p></aside>\n<p>As you can read from table 2, the different groups within our sample do have different preferences. The nerds have a higher intention to buy one of our SEO plugins than the other groups. However, the highest intention to buy a Yoast Theme is found among the group of women. Website reviews appear most popular among the young, male, non-nerds. Of course, some differences are small. These results nevertheless show that different groups within our audience prefer different products. We are now looking into possible strategies to optimize our sales. How can we better address women at our theme page? How can we reach young, male, non-nerds with our reviews? Conclusion: we are not done investigating…</p>\n<h2>Why could an audience analysis be important for you?</h2>\n<p>Knowing your audience means that you can anticipate upon the needs of your audience. And this in turn can increase your sales. Knowing the preferences of your public allows you to adapt your marketing and sales strategies. You should consider doing similar research if you don’t know your target audience well.  Even if you think you do, the results of research like this may well surprise you!</p>\n<p>This post first appeared on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yoast.com\">Yoast</a>.

We have never done such a thing at Yoast.com before. In this post, I will enlighten you with the purpose of our survey.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Yoast Research</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since the beginning of this year, Thijs and myself have been doing research. One day a week we are reading scientific articles in the university library and looking into new and exciting research techniques. We are currently reviewing an <a href=\"https://theeyetribe.com\">eyetracker</a> and looking into possibilities to use this eyetracker in one of our next research projects.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The aim of us doing research is twofold. Our first aim is to contribute knowledge to the scientific community and to the WordPress/Webdevelopment community. We would like to explore issues of usability, conversion and website optimization and write articles aimed to be published in scientific journals. Simultaneously, we will publish our results (in a less boring format) on Yoast.com.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have recently found out that there are in fact numerous excellent scholars already doing research in our area, but few of them share their knowledge with the online (WordPress) community. Lots of (scientific) knowledge thus does not reach the practitioners. I think that&#8217;s a waste of a lot of hard work. Why do difficult and expensive research if your results are never put to practice? Next to doing our own studies, we would therefore like to translate some of the existing research into practical posts on Yoast.com.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second aim of us doing research is not as altruistic. Doing research is really good for our own business as well! The information we collected with last week&#8217;s survey is inspiring. This kind of research gives great insights in who our audience is, where they are from, which products they bought and which products they intend to buy. Such data is a treasure trove!</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Knowing your audience!</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our first research project is aimed at getting to know our public better. It is a bit premature to present the results of our first study, so in this post I will limit myself to convince you all the importance of knowing your audience. Next to that, I will enlighten you a bit in the way you could study the audiences of your own website yourselves.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Joost began Yoast.com it was a blog. He wrote about both WordPress as well as SEO and most of his post were rather technical. Nowadays, Yoast offers plugins, themes and online consultancy, being much more than a blog. Also, posts aren’t only technical now. Our audience has grown rapidly during the last few years. And that made the researcher in me wonder: who is our audience nowadays? Do we still appeal to a technical (nerdy) group of people? Are our customers mainly developers? Or is our audience not that technically skilled? And what consequences would that have for the marketing of our products? I could imagine that a technically skilled developer is more easily convinced of the use of one of our plugins than someone without the ability to read code. These questions were the starting point of our research.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I decided to dive in the scientific literature about usability, online purchasing behavior and (internet) experience. Previous research has irrefutably established the importance of usability and user interface on the chance people buy online (e.g. Page, Robson &amp; Uncles, 2012; Chang &amp; Chen, 2008). However, studies also show that the relation between usability and online purchases is mediated by the level of (internet) experience people have (Gefen, Karahanna &amp; Straub, 2003; Castaneda, Munoz-Leiva an Luque, 2004). This means that experienced internet users thus respond differently to aspects of usability than the inexperienced ones. Different audiences have different usability needs.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Translating this scientific blabla to our own situation: It could well be that our technical experienced (nerdy) audience has other usability needs than our new, less skilled audience. Different groups could well need other things to make them buy our plugins! I would think that an audience with limited technical skills need more explanation, while a technical audience would just need our technical specifications in order to be convinced of our product. My non-nerdy background makes me think that some of our products do not appeal to new (not technically skilled) WordPress users, while they are in fact not that hard to install and use. Perhaps a shift in marketing approach is needed for this specific audience. In our survey, we put questions that will allow us to investigate upon my hypotheses. This week I will start analyzing the data and putting my hypotheses to the test. I can hardly wait!</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What should you be doing?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Google Analytics gives you a huge amount of data. But you are close to clueless about most of the demographics, the intentions and desires of your audience. Knowing your audience will allow you to anticipate on their needs and desires. You could adjust your assortment based on their preferences and largely improve your conversion. You thus should do a lot to get to know your audience and increase your sales.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are lots of packages that allow for online questionnaires. We have used <a href=\"http://polldaddy.com/\">Polldaddy.com</a> for our survey and I am really satisfied with their service. They offer a free account, which will be sufficient for most small companies. What I really like about polldaddy is the way they instantly present their results. They present frequencies and percentages in an easy to grasp format. You can set up a survey that pops up when someone enters your site or you can send a survey invitation to your newsletter subscribers. You can choose open questions if you have few visitors and questions with answer categories if you have many. Just by looking at these descriptive statistics can tell you lots about your audience. Of course, pretty data just begs for advanced and sophisticated analyses. I will save that for a next post ;-)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Yoast we are already very excited with our results (even before I started the really nice analyses). We have decided to do a survey on a yearly basis to determine the satisfaction of our customers. We would recommend all of you to do the same! Learn and profit by gaining as much information about your audience as possible. Placing a questionnaire on your website is a good first step!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I realize that this post could appear to be a bit scientific and difficult to read, but since our survey has made clear that the education level of our audience is sky-high, I&#8217;m not worried about that anymore ;-)</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Literature</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378720607000286\">Castañeda, J.

These posts will also explain why we made certain choices regarding our themes.</p>\n<p>With the release came a storm of reactions, some downright negative, but most of them (luckily) very positive! Some of the negative replies that struck us most were the replies that said they would&#8217;ve expected sliders, or even worse, thought the themes were &#8220;outdated&#8221; because they didn&#8217;t have sliders.</p>\n<p>Let me make one thing very clear: sliders suck. Of course, I entitle myself to my own opinion, and you&#8217;re entitled to yours. But let me explain why they suck.</p>\n<h2>Science</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s not often that science is conclusive in their findings. However, sliders (sometimes named carrousels) seem to be one topic on which it is. There&#8217;s literally not one study that I&#8217;ve found that says sliders are a good idea. I often point people to <a href=\"http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/\">http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/</a> when wanting to explain why <em>not</em> to use a slider. This simple website does an awesome job at showing the statistics as well as trigger the annoyance sliders usually evoke.</p>\n<p>Lets look at some of the statistics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://weedygarden.net/2013/01/carousel-stats/\">Only 1% of the people actually click on a slide</a>, which almost always was the first slide;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nngroup.com/articles/auto-forwarding/\">People simply ignore your slider</a>, because it triggers banner blindness;</li>\n<li>They slow down your site, <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/homepage-sliders-are-bad-for-seo-usability-163496\">negatively impacting your SEO and conversion rate(!!)</a>;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://krogsgard.com/2013/sliders-suck/\">They don&#8217;t always work well on mobile devices</a>,</li>\n<li>They push your content down, <a href=\"http://insidesearch.blogspot.nl/2012/01/page-layout-algorithm-improvement.html\">which Google recently mentioned yet again is <em>not</em> smart</a>;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://conversionxl.com/dont-use-automatic-image-sliders-or-carousels-ignore-the-fad/\">It dilutes your message</a>, because suddenly there are multiple messages on your homepage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>But&#8230; I&#8217;m a photographer!</h2>\n<p>Ok, so you&#8217;re a photographer. You should be allowed to use a slider, right? Wrong. People tend to act as if there&#8217;s no other way to show their images anymore but by sliders. This just isn&#8217;t true. If you couldn&#8217;t have a slider and you&#8217;re a photographer, would you just give up having a website altogether? Of course not, you would look for other options, such as the revolutionary idea of showing <em>static pictures</em>. If you want moving pictures, you should change careers and become a filmmaker.</p>\n<p>Seriously, whatever makes people think that having stuff <em>move</em> on your website is ever a good idea is still beyond me. You can create awesome collages through which people can browse <em>at will</em>. The pictures won&#8217;t be forced onto them (if they even notice them in the first place), they&#8217;ll just notice the ones they like. And trust me, that will sell better.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re really a photographer, you&#8217;re probably a creative person. You probably make photograph albums for people from time to time, which probably don&#8217;t have sliding images. So how about you showcase that skill and creativity by designing these pages with static images?</p>\n<h2>Focus</h2>\n<p>And, once again, it all comes down to focus. Basically, what you&#8217;re saying with a slider is: &#8220;I really don&#8217;t know which product or picture I should put on display on my homepage, so I&#8217;ll just grab 10 of them!&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know what to choose, how should your visitors or clients? You should know what your own business is about and what product or picture deserves that front page &#8220;shine&#8221;.

These posts will also explain why we made certain choices regarding our themes.</p>\n<p>With the release came a storm of reactions, some downright negative, but most of them (luckily) very positive! Some of the negative replies that struck us most were the replies that said they would&#8217;ve expected sliders, or even worse, thought the themes were &#8220;outdated&#8221; because they didn&#8217;t have sliders.</p>\n<p>Let me make one thing very clear: sliders suck. Of course, I entitle myself to my own opinion, and you&#8217;re entitled to yours. But let me explain why they suck.</p>\n<h2>Science</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s not often that science is conclusive in their findings. However, sliders (sometimes named carrousels) seem to be one topic on which it is. There&#8217;s literally not one study that I&#8217;ve found that says sliders are a good idea. I often point people to <a href=\"http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/\">http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/</a> when wanting to explain why <em>not</em> to use a slider. This simple website does an awesome job at showing the statistics as well as trigger the annoyance sliders usually evoke.</p>\n<p>Lets look at some of the statistics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://weedygarden.net/2013/01/carousel-stats/\">Only 1% of the people actually click on a slide</a>, which almost always was the first slide;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nngroup.com/articles/auto-forwarding/\">People simply ignore your slider</a>, because it triggers banner blindness;</li>\n<li>They slow down your site, <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/homepage-sliders-are-bad-for-seo-usability-163496\">negatively impacting your SEO and conversion rate(!!)</a>;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://krogsgard.com/2013/sliders-suck/\">They don&#8217;t always work well on mobile devices</a>,</li>\n<li>They push your content down, <a href=\"http://insidesearch.blogspot.nl/2012/01/page-layout-algorithm-improvement.html\">which Google recently mentioned yet again is <em>not</em> smart</a>;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://conversionxl.com/dont-use-automatic-image-sliders-or-carousels-ignore-the-fad/\">It dilutes your message</a>, because suddenly there are multiple messages on your homepage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>But&#8230; I&#8217;m a photographer!</h2>\n<p>Ok, so you&#8217;re a photographer. You should be allowed to use a slider, right? Wrong. People tend to act as if there&#8217;s no other way to show their images anymore but by sliders. This just isn&#8217;t true. If you couldn&#8217;t have a slider and you&#8217;re a photographer, would you just give up having a website altogether? Of course not, you would look for other options, such as the revolutionary idea of showing <em>static pictures</em>. If you want moving pictures, you should change careers and become a filmmaker.</p>\n<p>Seriously, whatever makes people think that having stuff <em>move</em> on your website is ever a good idea is still beyond me. You can create awesome collages through which people can browse <em>at will</em>. The pictures won&#8217;t be forced onto them (if they even notice them in the first place), they&#8217;ll just notice the ones they like. And trust me, that will sell better.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re really a photographer, you&#8217;re probably a creative person. You probably make photograph albums for people from time to time, which probably don&#8217;t have sliding images. So how about you showcase that skill and creativity by designing these pages with static images?</p>\n<h2>Focus</h2>\n<p>And, once again, it all comes down to focus. Basically, what you&#8217;re saying with a slider is: &#8220;I really don&#8217;t know which product or picture I should put on display on my homepage, so I&#8217;ll just grab 10 of them!&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know what to choose, how should your visitors or clients? You should know what your own business is about and what product or picture deserves that front page &#8220;shine&#8221;. By showing that, you will give people a far better feel of your business, and you as a person, than a slider ever could. Not in the least because sliders, as I&#8217;ve said twice now, are simply ignored. And a message that&#8217;s ignored hardly ever comes across (hint the sarcasm).</p>\n<h2>SEO and Conversion Rate Optimization</h2>\n<p>Sliders push down your content, plain and simple.

Most importantly it makes sure the taxonomy metadata is carried over well.</p>\n<h2>Twitter cards enabled by default</h2>\n<p>Recently, Twitter removed the need to validate your site before Twitter cards worked. This made it possible for us to enable Twitter cards by default, which we&#8217;ve done in this release. Now, if you&#8217;re installing WordPress SEO on a new site, you&#8217;ll get Twitter Cards as soon as you&#8217;ve activated the plugin.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also removed the use of the <code>twitter:url</code> meta tag, as Twitter no longer uses it and uses the canonical instead.</p>\n<h2>Update the Facebook API to its latest version</h2>\n<p>Changes like these are the kind of under the hood changes that nobody notices but are important nonetheless: Facebook has updated its API to a new version and is deprecating the old one. This leads to us being required to update the code in our plugin. You&#8217;ll notice some minor interface changes, but most of the stuff is under the hood.</p>\n<h2>Plugin conflict notices</h2>\n<p>Some plugins don&#8217;t really work together. For instance if two plugins add Facebook OpenGraph code to a page, Facebooks output becomes uncontrollable. For this reason we&#8217;re showing conflict notices when you install a plugin that does something our plugin does too. You can ignore them if you want to, but it should help prevent the &#8220;huh why isn&#8217;t this working&#8221; type issues.</p>\n<h2>Validation messages everywhere!</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using a featured image for your social meta data, and that image is too small to work with Facebook, we&#8217;ll now show you an error. Also, if you&#8217;re editing title and description templates on the SEO → Titles &amp; Metas page and you use a variable that isn&#8217;t available for that template, we&#8217;ll give you a helpful warning.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This post first appeared as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress-seo-2-1-release-notes/\">WordPress SEO 2.1: release notes</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yoast.com\">Yoast</a>.

Don&#8217;t just update our plugins, update <em>all</em> of them!!</p>\n<h2>The backstory</h2>\n<p>There are several issues fixed in these releases, so we&#8217;ve got individual <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress-seo-2-1-release-notes/\">release posts for WP SEO</a> and <a href=\"https://yoast.com/google-analytics-5-4-notes/%\">for our GA plugin</a>. The main issue we&#8217;re fixing with this release is the wrong usage of <code>add_query_arg</code> and <code>remove_query_arg</code> we had in both our <a title=\"WordPress SEO Plugin\" href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/\">WordPress SEO plugin</a> and our <a title=\"Google Analytics by Yoast\" href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/google-analytics/\">Google Analytics by Yoast plugin</a>.</p>\n<p>This issue was responsibly disclosed to us by Johannes Schmitt of <a href=\"https://scrutinizer-ci.com/\">Scrutinizer CI</a> (thank you!!), who found it in our SEO plugin. We discussed it with our partners at Sucuri. At first we thought it wasn&#8217;t exploitable, later on we found it allowed for XSS. In our case, you needed to be logged in as an admin to be XSS&#8217;ed, but still this was an issue to fix.</p>\n<p>I, Joost, created the particular problem myself and was wondering how that had gotten by me, when I figured out that both the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_query_arg\">Codex</a> and the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_query_arg/\">developer documentation</a> on WordPress.org for these functions were missing the fact that you had to escape their output. In fact, the examples in them when copied would create exploitable code straight away. I spoke to Samuel, mostly known in the WordPress community as Otto42, and he fixed the codex. A day later, the developer docs were amended as well.</p>\n<p>We were ready to do a security release last Wednesday. I was hesitant as I was guessing that more people had made the same mistake, because of the documentation. I talked to Dion Hulse, one of the people on the WordPress.org plugins team, and started doing a search, together with the team at Sucuri. We quickly found we were <em>far</em> from the only one.</p>\n<h2>A coordinated security release</h2>\n<p>As we researched, we quickly identified a few dozen affected plugins, lots of them major; the affected plugins include Gravity Forms, Easy Digital Downloads, Jetpack, WP e-Commerce, All In One SEO pack and that&#8217;s just some of the big ones. Based on this info Daniel Cid at <a href=\"https://sucuri.net/\">Sucuri</a> and myself started reaching out to those plugin developers and coordinating a big security update between all of us. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">WordPress Slack</a> proved to be <i>very</i> helpful for this kind of coordination.</p>\n<p>Some of these plugins had XSS issues on the frontend. We did not, so when the core team offered to do an automatic update, we opted out. The last time we did an automatic update (this is an update your WordPress installs automatically without your intervention), our WordPress SEO plugin got disabled on hundreds of sites and we didn&#8217;t want that to happen. Choices like these are tough to make: some sites might have a minor security issue now, but for many sites not having our SEO plugin enabled might actually be worse.</p>\n<p>I must say I&#8217;m quite proud of the community getting together like this and coordinating a release in such a fluent way. There are in total 44 people in the Slack group coordinating this release, and everyone is being very professional in dealing with it. After all, we&#8217;re updating dozens of plugins, and most of them had only 3 to 4 days notice, including a weekend. All these  WordPress plugin developer working together with the WordPress core security team, makes me proud to be a part of this community!</p>\n<h2>For users: I don&#8217;t see the update yet!</h2>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t see the update yet, go to your <code>wp-admin/update-core.php</code> page, under Dashboard → Updates, this will clear the cache for all updates and should then show you the updates for our plugins.</p>\n<p>Going to this page will also make sure any automatic updates are done a few seconds later too. Be sure to check your plugins page a minute or so later to see if all the needed plugins are still active.</p>\n<h2>For developers: how to fix the issue</h2>\n<p>The short version for developers of how to fix this issue: if you&#8217;re using either <code>add_query_arg</code> or <code>remove_query_arg</code> without passing in the URL, it bases the URL it creates off of <code>$_SERVER[\'REQUEST_URI\']</code>. In that process, it URL <em>decodes</em> the parameter names in the request URI, allowing for XSS. The solution is to simply wrap the output in <code>esc_url</code> and you&#8217;re done. Not a hard fix, but it has to be done.</p>\n<p>If you think your plugin or theme is vulnerable and want to find out, feel free to reach out to me on WordPress Slack (I&#8217;m @joostdevalk there) and I&#8217;ll show you how to exploit it. As there are still bound to be vulnerable plugins and themes out there, I&#8217;m not going to explain that here.</p>\n<p>This post first appeared as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yoast.com/coordinated-security-release/\">Security updates for our GA and SEO plugins &#038; many others</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yoast.com\">Yoast</a>.

A lot of the times, this is a legitimate drop and people were actually in a bit of trouble. However, more often than not there wasn&#8217;t anything wrong with either the traffic or the rankings.</p>\n<p>So today I&#8217;ll be explaining where you should and should not be looking when checking whether your site is doing well or not.</p>\n<h2>My traffic dropped!</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve seen quite a few clients who claimed to see a drop in their traffic. On investigation, we could not find any such drop anywhere. When checking your traffic, there&#8217;s only one place you need to go: Google Analytics. I don&#8217;t really trust any other tool to give me the right analytics or data.</p>\n<p>However, Google Analytics isn&#8217;t that straightforward, so let me tell you where to look, when looking for a drop due to bad SEO. When looking at overall traffic related to SEO, this is the most important place you need to check (<a href=\"https://yoast.com/tracking-seo-google-analytics/\">read this post</a> for a more info on SEO in Google Analytics); the Acquisition &gt; All Traffic &gt; Channels section:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding alignnone wp-image-364699 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Channels_-_Google_Analytics.png\" alt=\"Channels Google Analytics\" width=\"201\" height=\"377\" /></p>\n<p>This will give you a line chart of your site&#8217;s total traffic as well as a complete overview of this traffic divided into different &#8220;channels&#8221;. A channel is basically a couple of sources (where your visitors come from) grouped into one. So any traffic from either Bing, Google, Yahoo, Yandex or any other search engine will be combined in the channel &#8220;Organic Search&#8221;. Any traffic from Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, etc. will be combined in the channel &#8220;Social&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Do you see a drop in the line chart this metric gives you? If not, you&#8217;re probably doing fine. If you are, don&#8217;t panic <em>just yet. </em>There are a few things you can do to make sure this drop is actually related to SEO.</p>\n<h3>Organic Search</h3>\n<p>Google Analytics gives you the ability to see just the traffic from search engines. There are two ways of doing this. The first is probably the easiest: you just click &#8220;Organic Search&#8221; in the list:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-364709\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Channels_-_Google_Analytics2.png\" alt=\"Channels_-_Google_Analytics\" width=\"287\" height=\"457\" /></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll now get a line chart and statistics from just this channel. This can be useful, but it also makes it impossible to compare the traffic from this channel with traffic from other channels. So my personal preference is to select the checkbox before the traffic channel I want to view and then click that &#8220;Plot Rows&#8221; button at the top. This will give you a second line in the line chart, like this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-364716 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Channels_-_Google_Analytics4-550x171.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"171\" /></p>\n<p>So the blue line is the total traffic, and the orange line is the traffic from search engines. As you can see, there are some spikes in our total traffic that have <em>nothing </em>to do with our traffic from search engines. So they don&#8217;t have anything to do with SEO efforts on our part. These spikes actually came from newsletters and social media.</p>\n<p>And it works the same way the other way around: you might have a drop in traffic that has nothing to do with your SEO efforts. Something could&#8217;ve gone wrong in your social media, or maybe your newsletter wound up in everyone&#8217;s spam folder. So always check for the source of the drop, before blaming it on bad SEO.</p>\n<h3>Check the right timeframe and period</h3>\n<p>As you can see in the above screenshot, the graph is set to one point per day and covers a timeframe of about 1,5 month. This is fine if your traffic is steady. However, if your business (and thus your traffic) is more seasonal, this might not be the best timeframe. Put it up to a year or half a year so you can see if your traffic is actually lower than usual around that time.</p>\n<p>Also, if your timeframe includes the current month, day or week, please be aware that the last point in your line graph will always be lower. You see the same thing happening in the last screenshot; the last point drops off. This is not because our traffic dropped, this is simply because the last point is today, and today is still not finished and will accumulate a lot more traffic. The same thing goes for weeks and months.</p>\n<h2>My ranking dropped!</h2>\n<p>This one is a bit harder to check, unfortunately. The thing is, Google has personalized search. So what shows up for you when you search a specific keyword won&#8217;t show up for me. The results are based on your personal browsing behavior and a lot more which I won&#8217;t go into here.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had clients stating they were already ranking #1 for everything they wanted. This can actually happen if you google yourself a lot and only click through to your own site. Long story short, it&#8217;s pretty hard to use Google to find out how your rankings are doing. Of course, using Google in a private browser session can give you <em>some</em> indication. In fact, most tools aren&#8217;t much more than that; an indication.</p>\n<h3>PageRank</h3>\n<p>A lot of people still cling to the idea of Google PageRank. However, this doesn&#8217;t mean anything. Google has <a href=\"https://productforums.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!category-topic/webmasters/webmaster-tools/29GtmYDt8L0\">deprecated</a> the entire thing as far back as 2009. Google always tried to encourage people to look at other metrics such as Google Analytics. These simply give you far more insight into how your site&#8217;s doing.</p>\n<p>So simply put: a drop or rise in Google PageRank doesn&#8217;t mean your rankings have dropped or risen. It doesn&#8217;t really mean anything.</p>\n<h3>Ranking trackers</h3>\n<p>At Yoast, we&#8217;re not fan of ranking trackers which give you a very general idea of how your ranking is doing. It doesn&#8217;t matter what number website you are in the world compared to all other websites, it matters how you&#8217;re doing in your field of work.</p>\n<p>Another issue these trackers have is they track <em>all </em>your rankings. This won&#8217;t be an issue for everyone, but for us it means that our rankings fluctuate a lot. The cause for this is that we rank well for the term &#8220;Google Analytics&#8221;. These rankings tend to fluctuate quite a bit and there&#8217;s a lot of searching going on for these terms. So every time we drop or rise a bit, the rankings in these trackers shoot up or down as well, even though the users weren&#8217;t looking for us.</p>\n<p>These tools can give a general indication, but should not be used as anything other than that.</p>\n<h3>Google Webmaster Tools</h3>\n<p>Google Webmaster Tools (GWT) is one of the tools that I would recommend using to check how your site&#8217;s doing. We <a href=\"https://yoast.com/tag/webmaster-tools/\">explained GWT in detail</a> a few weeks ago, but I&#8217;ll just quickly show you where to find the most important metrics:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-364768\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Webmaster_Tools_-_Search_Queries_-_https___yoast_com_.png\" alt=\"Webmaster Tools Search Queries https yoast com \" width=\"167\" height=\"167\" /></p>\n<p>The Search Queries section shows you how many impressions your site has had and how many clicks resulted from those impressions. An impression is every time your website shows up in the search results the user is looking at. If either of these metrics is going down, you&#8217;ll know something is up. Obviously play with the timeframe here as well, so you know for sure it&#8217;s not a temporary drop.</p>\n<p>Next is the Index Status section:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-364773\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Webmaster_Tools_-_Index_Status_-_https___yoast_com_.png\" alt=\"Webmaster Tools Index Status https yoast com \" width=\"155\" height=\"122\" /></p>\n<p>This metric will show you how many pages are actually indexed in Google. This is obviously an important metric as well, so a steady or rising line is what you&#8217;re looking for. If this line is dropping (without you having disallowed pages, for example), this is definitely something to look into.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>When you want to check your site&#8217;s SEO yourself, I recommend only paying attention to Google Analytics and Google Webmaster Tools. Other tools are fine for giving a general idea or indication, but nothing more than that. Be sure to check the things I&#8217;ve told you to check so you know for sure it&#8217;s an SEO problem.

The first is probably the easiest: you just click &#8220;Organic Search&#8221; in the list:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-364709\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Channels_-_Google_Analytics2.png\" alt=\"Channels_-_Google_Analytics\" width=\"287\" height=\"457\" /></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll now get a line chart and statistics from just this channel. This can be useful, but it also makes it impossible to compare the traffic from this channel with traffic from other channels. So my personal preference is to select the checkbox before the traffic channel I want to view and then click that &#8220;Plot Rows&#8221; button at the top. This will give you a second line in the line chart, like this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-364716 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Channels_-_Google_Analytics4-550x171.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"171\" /></p>\n<p>So the blue line is the total traffic, and the orange line is the traffic from search engines. As you can see, there are some spikes in our total traffic that have <em>nothing </em>to do with our traffic from search engines. So they don&#8217;t have anything to do with SEO efforts on our part. These spikes actually came from newsletters and social media.</p>\n<p>And it works the same way the other way around: you might have a drop in traffic that has nothing to do with your SEO efforts. Something could&#8217;ve gone wrong in your social media, or maybe your newsletter wound up in everyone&#8217;s spam folder. So always check for the source of the drop, before blaming it on bad SEO.</p>\n<h3>Check the right timeframe and period</h3>\n<p>As you can see in the above screenshot, the graph is set to one point per day and covers a timeframe of about 1,5 month. This is fine if your traffic is steady. However, if your business (and thus your traffic) is more seasonal, this might not be the best timeframe. Put it up to a year or half a year so you can see if your traffic is actually lower than usual around that time.</p>\n<p>Also, if your timeframe includes the current month, day or week, please be aware that the last point in your line graph will always be lower. You see the same thing happening in the last screenshot; the last point drops off. This is not because our traffic dropped, this is simply because the last point is today, and today is still not finished and will accumulate a lot more traffic. The same thing goes for weeks and months.</p>\n<h2>My ranking dropped!</h2>\n<p>This one is a bit harder to check, unfortunately. The thing is, Google has personalized search. So what shows up for you when you search a specific keyword won&#8217;t show up for me. The results are based on your personal browsing behavior and a lot more which I won&#8217;t go into here.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had clients stating they were already ranking #1 for everything they wanted. This can actually happen if you google yourself a lot and only click through to your own site. Long story short, it&#8217;s pretty hard to use Google to find out how your rankings are doing. Of course, using Google in a private browser session can give you <em>some</em> indication. In fact, most tools aren&#8217;t much more than that; an indication.</p>\n<h3>PageRank</h3>\n<p>A lot of people still cling to the idea of Google PageRank. However, this doesn&#8217;t mean anything. Google has <a href=\"https://productforums.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!category-topic/webmasters/webmaster-tools/29GtmYDt8L0\">deprecated</a> the entire thing as far back as 2009. Google always tried to encourage people to look at other metrics such as Google Analytics. These simply give you far more insight into how your site&#8217;s doing.</p>\n<p>So simply put: a drop or rise in Google PageRank doesn&#8217;t mean your rankings have dropped or risen. It doesn&#8217;t really mean anything.</p>\n<h3>Ranking trackers</h3>\n<p>At Yoast, we&#8217;re not fan of ranking trackers which give you a very general idea of how your ranking is doing. It doesn&#8217;t matter what number website you are in the world compared to all other websites, it matters how you&#8217;re doing in your field of work.</p>\n<p>Another issue these trackers have is they track <em>all </em>your rankings. This won&#8217;t be an issue for everyone, but for us it means that our rankings fluctuate a lot. The cause for this is that we rank well for the term &#8220;Google Analytics&#8221;. These rankings tend to fluctuate quite a bit and there&#8217;s a lot of searching going on for these terms. So every time we drop or rise a bit, the rankings in these trackers shoot up or down as well, even though the users weren&#8217;t looking for us.</p>\n<p>These tools can give a general indication, but should not be used as anything other than that.</p>\n<h3>Google Webmaster Tools</h3>\n<p>Google Webmaster Tools (GWT) is one of the tools that I would recommend using to check how your site&#8217;s doing. We <a href=\"https://yoast.com/tag/webmaster-tools/\">explained GWT in detail</a> a few weeks ago, but I&#8217;ll just quickly show you where to find the most important metrics:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-364768\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Webmaster_Tools_-_Search_Queries_-_https___yoast_com_.png\" alt=\"Webmaster Tools Search Queries https yoast com \" width=\"167\" height=\"167\" /></p>\n<p>The Search Queries section shows you how many impressions your site has had and how many clicks resulted from those impressions. An impression is every time your website shows up in the search results the user is looking at. If either of these metrics is going down, you&#8217;ll know something is up. Obviously play with the timeframe here as well, so you know for sure it&#8217;s not a temporary drop.</p>\n<p>Next is the Index Status section:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-364773\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Webmaster_Tools_-_Index_Status_-_https___yoast_com_.png\" alt=\"Webmaster Tools Index Status https yoast com \" width=\"155\" height=\"122\" /></p>\n<p>This metric will show you how many pages are actually indexed in Google. This is obviously an important metric as well, so a steady or rising line is what you&#8217;re looking for. If this line is dropping (without you having disallowed pages, for example), this is definitely something to look into.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>When you want to check your site&#8217;s SEO yourself, I recommend only paying attention to Google Analytics and Google Webmaster Tools. Other tools are fine for giving a general idea or indication, but nothing more than that. Be sure to check the things I&#8217;ve told you to check so you know for sure it&#8217;s an SEO problem.

We asked <a href=\"http://www.linkresearchtools.com/\">Christoph at LinkResearchTools</a> to check all of the information in there to make sure we were not missing anything.<br />\nWhen going over that post, we felt that we should elaborate on the subject of link building on our website, although link building is not the same (trade) as website optimization. And that is why we are pleased to present you with this post Christoph wrote for you.</p>\n<p>In this article, you will find practical tips and <strong>smart alternatives to dangerous link building strategies</strong>.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Link building today: &#8220;Sweat plus creativity&#8221;</h2>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding alignright wp-image-353555 size-medium\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/smart-link-building-techniques-250x177.jpg\" alt=\"Smart Alternatives to Dangerous Link Building Strategies\" width=\"250\" height=\"177\" />Before the first Google Penguin update in 2012, people just wanted to build as many links as possible, using any available means. In the Penguin era the focus has shifted to white hat SEO; building trusted and powerful links. Is this easy? Of course it’s not!</p>\n<p>Building high quality links is no easy job. As Matt Cutts said (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qglAm8QiX5k\">SMX, June 2014</a>) it&#8217;s possible to do white hat SEO, but this takes &#8220;Sweat plus creativity”. All of a sudden link building stopped being an easy thing to do, because Google’s search algorithm grew more complex, easily detecting any attempts of manipulation.</p>\n<p>Avoiding dangerous link building strategies and understanding how you can build links the right way is really important if you want to keep your position top in the search engines.</p>\n<h2>Industrial &#8220;Penguin Proof&#8221; link building. Really?</h2>\n<p>There are hundreds of thousands of agencies that offer link building services. It’s cheap, it’s fast, you don’t have to struggle at all and they often claim that the links they build overnight are “Penguin proof”. It looks like you found the perfect deal. What else could you wish for? It sounds too good to be true and most probably, it is.</p>\n<p>Quantity is not quality and a link building strategy that doesn’t add value to anyone is something that Google calls spam:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Any links intended to manipulate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank\">PageRank</a> or a site&#8217;s ranking in Google search results may be considered part of a link scheme and a violation of Google’s <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/answer.py?answer=35769\">Webmaster Guidelines</a>. This includes any behavior that manipulates links to your site or outgoing links from your site.”</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Bad link building strategies and smart alternatives</h2>\n<h3>1. Buying or selling links</h3>\n<p>Google clearly states that buying backlinks to improve your rankings is against their webmaster quality guidelines. They see links as votes and it’s not ethical to pay for votes. Links bought from sites that openly state that they sell links, are your ticket to a Google Penalty!</p>\n<p><strong>Smart solution<br />\n<img class=\"nopadding alignright wp-image-353565 size-medium\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/high-quality-content-250x211.png\" alt=\"Focus on links in high quality content, to high quality content\" width=\"250\" height=\"211\" /></strong>Instead of buying links, you can invest in creating high quality content that will attract natural backlinks. Taking this approach doesn’t cost you more than buying a bunch of bad links, and you can ultimately achieve much better results, it just requires more patience, “sweat plus creativity”.</p>\n<p>The secret to success is placing a link inside high quality content and making sure it leads to high quality content.</p>\n<p>Here’s what <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356?hl=en\">Google</a> says about links and content:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The best way to get other sites to create high-quality, relevant links to yours is to create unique, relevant content that can naturally gain popularity in the Internet community. Creating good content pays off: Links are usually editorial votes given by choice, and the more useful content you have, the greater the chances someone else will find that content valuable to their readers and link to it.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you want a risk-free approach to SEO then don’t buy links. If you ever bought some, <strong><a href=\"http://try.linkresearchtools.com/partnerships_yoast_lrt\">get rid of them now</a>!</strong></p>\n<h3>2. Excessive link exchanges</h3>\n<p>Exchanging links with people you know just for the sake of cross-linking will negatively impact your website’s ranking in search results. Here is an example of how reciprocal linking can go wrong: You have a website about legal services and you link to a bakery and have that bakery website link to you, then you may have just created a worthless link. Imagine that you continue by linking to coffee shops, clothing stores, computer repair businesses, garden equipment and so on and they all link back to you. This reciprocal link exchange may cause Google to penalize your website.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart solution</strong><br />\nAs long as reciprocal linking is not done excessively and these links make sense and are relevant to the users of both websites, there is nothing to worry about.</p>\n<p>If the website of a Court Office links to a legal website and the legal website has a link to the Court Office, this link is not harmful. It may not have great value for boosting a website’s ranking, but it surely provides value to the users of both websites.</p>\n<h3>3. Massive article marketing or guest posting campaigns with keyword-rich anchor text links</h3>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding alignright wp-image-353568 size-medium\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/anchor-text-250x211.png\" alt=\"Focus on natural anchor text\" width=\"250\" height=\"211\" />It’s great that people write about you and link back to your website, but just as long as they create links in a natural way. Stuffing the anchor text with money keywords is far from natural and will surely get you in trouble.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart solution</strong><br />\nUsing brand keywords or navigational phrases is a good option in this case. Obsessing about money anchor text is wrong. It’s important to have anchor texts that are relevant to your website, but keep in mind that using money keywords as anchor text for all your inbound links is a bad practice and it may put you on Google’s blacklist.</p>\n<h3>4. Adding links to any link directory</h3>\n<p>Adding your site to any web directory just to get a backlink will have a negative effect on your website’s ranking. Most web directories out there provide no real value to the Internet users and Google has excluded them from its search results. You don’t want your website to be in there!</p>\n<p><strong>Smart solution<br />\n</strong>Search for trusted directories. There are a few for every niche. These directories provide useful information to you, your target audience and your potential customers.</p>\n<p>The new PageRank is relevancy, therefore building links in niche directories and directories belonging to informative websites relevant for your industry are beneficial for you.</p>\n<h3>5. Optimized links placed in unhelpful forum or blog comments</h3>\n<p>Participating in forum discussions and adding random comments to any blog out there, overusing money keywords in your anchor texts is completely wrong and spammy.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart solution<br />\n</strong>Participate in an active discussion on a forum or blog that is relevant to your business and make sure that your comment provides contextual value to the discussion. Now you don’t have to worry about sharing a relevant link.</p>\n<h3>6. Web directory listings</h3>\n<p>Adding your site to any web directory just to get a backlink will have a negative effect on your website’s ranking. Most directories provide no real value to the Internet users and Google has excluded them from its search results. Again, you don’t want your website to be in there.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart solution<br />\n</strong>There are some good directories that also provide useful information for you and your potential customers and are closely related to your industry.</p>\n<p>For example a business web directory that specializes in legal services and lists lawyers all over the world. With listings organized by practice area and location, this would be a place that would help a user find the best lawyer for their case.</p>\n<p>At the same time the directory can contain a knowledge database with the most recent legal updates in the world. This web directory is both valuable for people that need a lawyer and for lawyers themselves.</p>\n<h2>In conclusion</h2>\n<p>Real link building is no easy job.

We asked <a href=\"http://www.linkresearchtools.com/\">Christoph at LinkResearchTools</a> to check all of the information in there to make sure we were not missing anything.<br />\nWhen going over that post, we felt that we should elaborate on the subject of link building on our website, although link building is not the same (trade) as website optimization. And that is why we are pleased to present you with this post Christoph wrote for you.</p>\n<p>In this article, you will find practical tips and <strong>smart alternatives to dangerous link building strategies</strong>.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Link building today: &#8220;Sweat plus creativity&#8221;</h2>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding alignright wp-image-353555 size-medium\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/smart-link-building-techniques-250x177.jpg\" alt=\"Smart Alternatives to Dangerous Link Building Strategies\" width=\"250\" height=\"177\" />Before the first Google Penguin update in 2012, people just wanted to build as many links as possible, using any available means. In the Penguin era the focus has shifted to white hat SEO; building trusted and powerful links. Is this easy? Of course it’s not!</p>\n<p>Building high quality links is no easy job. As Matt Cutts said (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qglAm8QiX5k\">SMX, June 2014</a>) it&#8217;s possible to do white hat SEO, but this takes &#8220;Sweat plus creativity”. All of a sudden link building stopped being an easy thing to do, because Google’s search algorithm grew more complex, easily detecting any attempts of manipulation.</p>\n<p>Avoiding dangerous link building strategies and understanding how you can build links the right way is really important if you want to keep your position top in the search engines.</p>\n<h2>Industrial &#8220;Penguin Proof&#8221; link building. Really?</h2>\n<p>There are hundreds of thousands of agencies that offer link building services. It’s cheap, it’s fast, you don’t have to struggle at all and they often claim that the links they build overnight are “Penguin proof”. It looks like you found the perfect deal. What else could you wish for? It sounds too good to be true and most probably, it is.</p>\n<p>Quantity is not quality and a link building strategy that doesn’t add value to anyone is something that Google calls spam:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Any links intended to manipulate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank\">PageRank</a> or a site&#8217;s ranking in Google search results may be considered part of a link scheme and a violation of Google’s <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/answer.py?answer=35769\">Webmaster Guidelines</a>. This includes any behavior that manipulates links to your site or outgoing links from your site.”</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Bad link building strategies and smart alternatives</h2>\n<h3>1. Buying or selling links</h3>\n<p>Google clearly states that buying backlinks to improve your rankings is against their webmaster quality guidelines. They see links as votes and it’s not ethical to pay for votes. Links bought from sites that openly state that they sell links, are your ticket to a Google Penalty!</p>\n<p><strong>Smart solution<br />\n<img class=\"nopadding alignright wp-image-353565 size-medium\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/high-quality-content-250x211.png\" alt=\"Focus on links in high quality content, to high quality content\" width=\"250\" height=\"211\" /></strong>Instead of buying links, you can invest in creating high quality content that will attract natural backlinks. Taking this approach doesn’t cost you more than buying a bunch of bad links, and you can ultimately achieve much better results, it just requires more patience, “sweat plus creativity”.</p>\n<p>The secret to success is placing a link inside high quality content and making sure it leads to high quality content.</p>\n<p>Here’s what <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356?hl=en\">Google</a> says about links and content:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The best way to get other sites to create high-quality, relevant links to yours is to create unique, relevant content that can naturally gain popularity in the Internet community. Creating good content pays off: Links are usually editorial votes given by choice, and the more useful content you have, the greater the chances someone else will find that content valuable to their readers and link to it.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you want a risk-free approach to SEO then don’t buy links.

This release adds new features for Google&#8217;s Knowledge Graph and improves the design, layout &amp; usability of the WordPress SEO plugins admin screens in many ways.</p>\n<h2>Google Knowledge Graph</h2>\n<p>Google recently introduced new features for their <a href=\"http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html\">knowledge graph</a>, allowing you to highlight yourself in the search results as either a company or a person. This includes you or your company&#8217;s name, if your site is for a company, the logo:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone nopadding size-large wp-image-353546\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/google-knowledge-graph-info-550x222.png\" alt=\"google knowledge graph info\" width=\"550\" height=\"222\" /></p>\n<p>And it includes your social profiles (this is the list of social networks <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/structured-data/customize/social-profiles\">Google supports</a> in their social markup):</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding alignnone wp-image-353622 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/social-profiles-tab1-550x337.png\" alt=\"Social Profiles tab in WordPress SEO 2.0\" width=\"550\" height=\"337\" /></p>\n<p>If Google has picked this all up and shows a Knowledge Graph block for you or your company (note that we can&#8217;t force it to do that), it would look like this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding alignnone wp-image-353648 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/knowledge-graph_1A752930-550x297.png\" alt=\"Google Knowledge Graph example\" width=\"550\" height=\"297\" /></p>\n<h2>Simplified the admin menus</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve decided to move several admin pages under one &#8220;Advanced&#8221; page, and several tools to a new &#8220;Tools&#8221; page. This makes our entire admin structure a lot cleaner (note the screenshots are for <a title=\"WordPress SEO Premium\" href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo-premium/\">WordPress SEO premium</a>), compare the old (left) versus the new (right):</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone noborder size-large wp-image-353531\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wordpress-seo-admin-menu-changes-550x606.jpg\" alt=\"wordpress seo admin menu changes\" width=\"400\" height=\"\" /></p>\n<p>While this might seem mostly a superficial change, it&#8217;s very important in how we think you should perceive our plugin. The most important thing you can do in SEO is write good content; the most important section of the plugin is thus the metabox on the edit post / pages.

This release adds new features for Google&#8217;s Knowledge Graph and improves the design, layout &amp; usability of the WordPress SEO plugins admin screens in many ways.</p>\n<h2>Google Knowledge Graph</h2>\n<p>Google recently introduced new features for their <a href=\"http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html\">knowledge graph</a>, allowing you to highlight yourself in the search results as either a company or a person. This includes you or your company&#8217;s name, if your site is for a company, the logo:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone nopadding size-large wp-image-353546\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/google-knowledge-graph-info-550x222.png\" alt=\"google knowledge graph info\" width=\"550\" height=\"222\" /></p>\n<p>And it includes your social profiles (this is the list of social networks <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/structured-data/customize/social-profiles\">Google supports</a> in their social markup):</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding alignnone wp-image-353622 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/social-profiles-tab1-550x337.png\" alt=\"Social Profiles tab in WordPress SEO 2.0\" width=\"550\" height=\"337\" /></p>\n<p>If Google has picked this all up and shows a Knowledge Graph block for you or your company (note that we can&#8217;t force it to do that), it would look like this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding alignnone wp-image-353648 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/knowledge-graph_1A752930-550x297.png\" alt=\"Google Knowledge Graph example\" width=\"550\" height=\"297\" /></p>\n<h2>Simplified the admin menus</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve decided to move several admin pages under one &#8220;Advanced&#8221; page, and several tools to a new &#8220;Tools&#8221; page. This makes our entire admin structure a lot cleaner (note the screenshots are for <a title=\"WordPress SEO Premium\" href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo-premium/\">WordPress SEO premium</a>), compare the old (left) versus the new (right):</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone noborder size-large wp-image-353531\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wordpress-seo-admin-menu-changes-550x606.jpg\" alt=\"wordpress seo admin menu changes\" width=\"400\" height=\"\" /></p>\n<p>While this might seem mostly a superficial change, it&#8217;s very important in how we think you should perceive our plugin. The most important thing you can do in SEO is write good content; the most important section of the plugin is thus the metabox on the edit post / pages. While the features hidden under the Advanced menu are very useful, they&#8217;re not going to make your ranking go from poor to awesome. By moving them all to one advanced page, we hope to make that emphasis more obvious.</p>\n<h2>WordPress SEO Premium changes</h2>\n<h3>Speed improvement</h3>\n<p>Not a feature, but a very welcome change: we&#8217;ve made WordPress SEO Premium much, much faster in this release. You&#8217;ll notice this in the admin of your site almost immediately.</p>\n<h3>Updated videos</h3>\n<p>Because we&#8217;ve changed all the admin screens, all the videos had to be redone, so in WordPress SEO Premium 2.0 you&#8217;ll find a completely new set of 13 videos made by <a href=\"http://shawnhesketh.com/\">Shawn Hesketh</a> of <a href=\"https://www.wp101.com/\">WP101</a>.

Not only did they add a Mobile Usability item under <a href=\"https://yoast.com/google-webmaster-tools-search-traffic/\">the Search Traffic section</a>, but they also sent out emails with the subject &#8220;Fix mobile usability issues found on &lt;website&gt;&#8221;. Obviously, Google is bringing mobile-friendliness under the website owner&#8217;s attention.</p>\n<p>So we thought it would be a good idea to explain what you should pay attention to and what we think you should be doing to prepare yourself for the update on April 21st.</p>\n<h2>The impact of this update will be <em>big</em></h2>\n<p>But before preparing you, lets convince you that it&#8217;s really important to take action, if you haven&#8217;t already. As Google mentioned in their own blogpost, the impact on the search results will be significant. Besides that, <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/how-large-is-googles-mobile-friendly-algorithm-larger-than-panda-or-penguin-217026\">Search Engine Land announced</a> that Zineb Ait Bahajji was quoted to say that the impact of this update will be bigger than Panda or Penguin, and that&#8217;s saying something.</p>\n<h2>Common issues</h2>\n<p>There are a few notices we saw quite a few times. We&#8217;re sure this is not a complete list, but it covers all the most common issues.</p>\n<h3>Viewport not configured/Fixed-width viewport</h3>\n<p>What this basically means is that you should make your website responsive. A responsive website will scale to any size automatically, without trying to show the entire website on a much smaller screen (such as a smartphone). Michiel actually wrote a great <a href=\"https://yoast.com/breaking-responsive-design/\">post about responsive design</a> that can help out a lot here.</p>\n<h3>Touch elements too close</h3>\n<p>This is a pretty straightforward notice. When viewing your website on a smartphone and/or tablet, the different areas a user is able to click on are too close to each other. This means that they might be misclicking, which is obviously annoying and not very user-friendly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/SizeTapTargetsAppropriately\">Google recommends</a> your important tap targets should be at least 48 CSS pixels tall/wide (with a properly configured viewport). If they&#8217;re any smaller than that, they should have additional spacing; no other tap targets should be within 32 CSS pixels of it (horizontally <em>and </em>vertically).</p>\n<h3>Small font size</h3>\n<p>This one is pretty straightforward as well. Google considers your font to be too small to be decently legible. Before fixing this, you&#8217;ll have to make sure you have your viewport configured properly. Google gives the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/UseLegibleFontSizes\">following recommendations</a> for your font size:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Use a base font size of 16 CSS pixels. Adjust the size as needed based on properties of the font being used.</li>\n<li>Use sizes relative to the base size to define the typographic scale.</li>\n<li>Text needs vertical space between its characters and may need to be adjusted for each font. The general recommendation is to use the browser default line-height of 1.2em.</li>\n<li>Restrict the number of fonts used and the typographic scale: too many fonts and font sizes lead to messy and overly complex page layouts.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Content not sized to viewport</h3>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve set your viewport up properly, you should not forget about your content. Any elements with a fixed width will still make sure your otherwise (hopefully) responsive site becomes unusable on mobile devices. So you should be aware of the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Any large elements (such as images) are not using a fixed width;</li>\n<li>Content should not be set to one specific viewport width;</li>\n<li>You should be using CSS media queries to give different styling to smaller screens than to larger screens.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Make your website responsive</h2>\n<p>By now I hope you got the gist of what it is Google is trying to tell you: make your website responsive. They&#8217;ve even made a complete <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/webmasters/mobile-sites/get-started/\">guide to mobile-friendly sites</a>. There&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/\">mobile-friendly test</a>, which will give you either of these responses:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding alignnone wp-image-352625 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Mobile-Friendly_Test.png\" alt=\"Mobile Friendly Test\" width=\"373\" height=\"58\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding alignnone wp-image-352627 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Mobile-Friendly_Test1.png\" alt=\"Mobile-Friendly_Test\" width=\"197\" height=\"58\" /></p>\n<p>And when you get the message the page is not mobile-friendly, they&#8217;ll obviously also tell you why it&#8217;s not. This might be a nice tool to use for new pages, for example. However, it&#8217;s only per page, so checking your entire website is probably not the best option. That&#8217;s why you can also check the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-usability\">Mobile Usability section</a> in your Google Webmaster Tools. This will give you a list of all the pages that gave errors that Google found.</p>\n<p>Another great and really simple way to check whether your website is responsive or not, is to just resize your browser window. If your website doesn&#8217;t scale with the size of your browser window, it&#8217;s probably not responsive.</p>\n<h2>Can I do anything else?</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re still unsure whether you&#8217;re doing everything you can do with your site, or you want professionals to take a look at the mobile usability (and a lot more) of your site, you should definitely <a href=\"https://yoast.com/hire-us/website-review/\">check out our Website Reviews</a>. We&#8217;ll personally check your site for any issues regarding mobile usability, and a whole lot more.</p>\n<h2>That&#8217;s it!</h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s not much more to it than this, really: make your website responsive. And <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/\">test mobile-friendliness</a> after that. Not only will this make sure you prevent getting &#8216;hit&#8217; by this update, it&#8217;ll actually make your website more usable for your visitors. And that&#8217;s what it should be about in the first place.

Our release of a <a title=\"WordPress SEO Security release\" href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress-seo-security-release/\">security update to WordPress SEO</a> was followed by several other major plugins uncovering similar issues and a renewed interest among security researchers into big WordPress plugins. Turns out we had another issue to patch, so today we released an update to our <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/google-analytics/\">Google Analytics plugin</a> (both free and premium) too.</p>\n<h2>How serious are these issues?</h2>\n<p>One of the things we should have probably communicated better is the severity of the issues at hand. Some of the news outlets made it seem as though someone could walk straight into your site because of these issues, which is not even close to true. Our partners at Sucuri did a post this week on <a href=\"http://blog.sucuri.net/2015/03/understanding-wordpress-plugin-vulnerabilities.html\">how to understand WordPress plugin vulnerabilities</a> that&#8217;s a good read.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve read that post you&#8217;ll learn about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAD:_Risk_assessment_model\">DREAD score</a>, both the WordPress SEO issue and todays Google Analytics by Yoast issue were assigned a DREAD score of 5.

I was actually made aware of this new feature by my colleague <a title=\"About Peter van Wilderen\" href=\"https://yoast.com/about-us/peter-van-wilderen/\">Peter</a>, who is working on our <a title=\"Google Analytics by Yoast\" href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/google-analytics/\">Google Analytics by Yoast Premium plugin</a>. We started looking at the new analysis together. As is often the case with Google Analytics, it wasn&#8217;t really clear right away. So that&#8217;s why I thought I&#8217;d delve into it a bit more and try to explain what this actually does for all of you!</p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s a cohort?</h2>\n<p>Before I can decently explain what Google Analytics&#8217; cohort analysis is about, it&#8217;s probably a smart idea to explain what a cohort is. When asking Google what the meaning of &#8216;cohort&#8217; is, it gives me this explanation:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-347000 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cohort_meaning_-_Google_Search.png\" alt=\"cohort meaning Google Search - cohort analysis google analytics\" width=\"522\" height=\"191\" /></p>\n<p>In this case, the second definition is obviously the one we&#8217;re looking for. A cohort is any group of people sharing a characteristic. In Google Analytics&#8217; case, the only characteristic to be shared you can select, at the moment, is Acquisition Date.</p>\n<h2>Cohort analysis</h2>\n<p>So a cohort analysis is basically the analysis of a group of people, in this case people who interacted with your website at the same date or date range. When clicking Cohort Analysis in Google Analytics, it&#8217;ll look something like this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-347017\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Cohort_Analysis_-_Google_Analytics.png\" alt=\"Cohort Analysis Google Analytics\" width=\"520\" height=\"433\" /></p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but this isn&#8217;t really immediately clear to me, so let me walk you through how to look at it. The chart at the top is a visualization of the average user rentention (percentage of returning visitors) for the date range, which is 7 days by default.</p>\n<p>The most interesting, however, is the table below the chart. This actually gives us insight in what percentage of people returned to your site within 7 days of visiting it for the first time. Day 0 corresponds with the date in the first column. Day 1 is the first day <em>after </em>someone visited your website for the first time. So the 4.32% at Day 1 in the March 10th row means that 4.32% of the people who visited yoast.com for the first time on March 10th, visited yoast.com again on the next day (March 11th). Day 2 is the second day (March 12th) and so on.</p>\n<p><em>Note: this is a breakdown of New Users, so although it says &#8220;All Sessions&#8221;, this only includes people having visited your site for the first time.</em></p>\n<h2>What can I do with this?</h2>\n<p>This is a question that I immediately asked myself. It wasn&#8217;t completely clear to me right away, so I might be a bit slow, or it&#8217;s just not that obvious. I&#8217;ll let you be the judge of that ;)</p>\n<p>Let me give you an example (not yoast.com, by the way):</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-347077\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Cohort_Analysis_-_Google_Analytics2.png\" alt=\"Cohort_Analysis_-_Google_Analytics\" width=\"540\" height=\"355\" /></p>\n<p>So what happened on March 14th or 15th that made people who visited this website for the first time on March 14th visit again the next day? The retention rate is about 2% higher there, and even on day 2 the retention rate is higher. Maybe they wrote a nice post? This can be a great way of figuring out whether what you&#8217;re trying (new content, new campaigns, etc.) is actually working.</p>\n<h3>Breaking down the cohort</h3>\n<p>If you need a more specific look on what&#8217;s happening, either because you don&#8217;t know why the retention rate was lower/higher, or because you&#8217;re just a data geek, you&#8217;re in luck. You can actually &#8216;break down&#8217; your cohort analysis by using segments. For instance, if I were to use the Mobile and Tablet Traffic segment on the data above:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-347120\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Cohort_Analysis_-_Google_Analytics4.png\" alt=\"Cohort_Analysis_-_Google_Analytics\" width=\"540\" height=\"285\" /></p>\n<p>Google Analytics will give me this cohort report:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-347118\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Cohort_Analysis_-_Google_Analytics3.png\" alt=\"Cohort_Analysis_-_Google_Analytics\" width=\"540\" height=\"277\" /></p>\n<p>This shows the data for people who not only visited your website for the first time in the set timeframe, but were also on a smartphone or tablet when viewing the site. You can have up to 4 of such segments active at the same time. This way you can see whether the (expected) effect happened for all sorts of people, such as people on mobile phones, people from search engines or direct visitors, etc.</p>\n<h2>Other metrics</h2>\n<p>You can actually select quite a few metrics that will make the cohort analysis useful for a lot more than returning visitors:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-347143\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Cohort_Analysis_-_Google_Analytics5.png\" alt=\"Cohort_Analysis_-_Google_Analytics\" width=\"508\" height=\"97\" /></p>\n<p>Although the Cohort Type has a dropdown, it actually just has the one option. The Cohort Size can be set to &#8216;by day&#8217;, &#8216;by week&#8217; or &#8216;by month&#8217; and the Date Range will change accordingly. The most interesting though, is the Metric dropdown. You can select a lot of per user metrics (revenue, pageviews, transactions, etc.) or total metrics (again revenue, pageviews, etc.) apart from the Retention metric I used in the examples above.</p>\n<p>This means you can actually see a lot of effects, such as whether your overall revenue or revenue per user has increased after a post or campaign. Of course, you can normally see your sales or revenue increase if you have a successful campaign, but this data is different.</p>\n<p>You can now see how much revenue you got from people that visited your website for the first time on a specific date and see if these new visitors bought something on that date or in the days to follow. And since you can see this for an entire date range, you&#8217;ll also be able to see if that&#8217;s a higher or lower revenue than was to be expected.</p>\n<p>Let me give you an example. Say you changed your landing page recently, which is tailored to just convincing new visitors of your site to buy a product. You could just be looking at the revenue from new visitors and see if it increases. However, if a visitor were to visit your website for the first time, only to return the next day to buy your product, Google Analytics wouldn&#8217;t show it as a new visitor anymore. And that&#8217;s why these cohorts actually work: the visitor was new at the set date, so even if they buy the product a day (or 2, or more) later, they&#8217;ll still show up in the cohort analysis. So you&#8217;re not just measuring direct effect anymore, you&#8217;re measuring delayed effects as well!</p>\n<p>By the way, to be sure you have just the visitors that visited that specific landing page, you should <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3124493?hl=en\">create a segment</a> for visitors who visited that page.</p>\n<h2>The downsides</h2>\n<p>While looking at the cohort analysis for yoast.com, I noticed that the Retention metric is quite difficult for our domain. Our traffic, even from the new visitors, is just too stable. The pattern was just the same all the time, no matter what date range I selected. This is probably because we have such a steady flow of new visitors, mainly from Google, that any lift here would only be a small change in percentage.</p>\n<p>So, the changes in the percentages are too small; if everything between 3.5% and 4.5% is the same color, it&#8217;s pretty hard to distinguish any real differences. Of course, I could just look at the percentages, but that&#8217;s just not as convenient.</p>\n<p>More importantly, though, we can only create cohorts based on Acquisition Date at the moment, which is a nice start, but I do really hope they&#8217;ll start adding more Cohort Types. Just the Acquisition Date is really not enough, for me at least. I&#8217;d love to see cohorts of people buying a specific product (category), for instance.</p>\n<h2>Summing up</h2>\n<p>The cohort analysis can definitely give you some insights that weren&#8217;t readily available before. However, it does still require more than just basic knowledge of Google Analytics and might be a little confusing in the beginning. So I&#8217;m not completely sold on this feature yet, but to be fair; it is still in beta, so who knows how much better it will get right?</p>\n<p>Did you think of any other cool ways of using the new cohort analysis feature? Or do you think I said something utterly stupid in this post?

So I&#8217;m not completely sold on this feature yet, but to be fair; it is still in beta, so who knows how much better it will get right?</p>\n<p>Did you think of any other cool ways of using the new cohort analysis feature?

The one sentence explanation for the not so technical: by having a logged-in author, editor or admin visit a malformed URL a malicious hacker could change your database.

This type of responsible disclosure is what keeps us all safe, but it only does so <em>if you update</em>.</p>\n<h2>Forced automatic update</h2>\n<p>Because of the severity of the issue, the WordPress.org team put out a forced automatic update (thanks!).

We have already emphasized this on our page on <a title=\"WordPress Security\" href=\"https://yoast.com/articles/wordpress-security/\">WordPress security</a>, of course. This section is about the security alerts in Bing Webmaster Tools.</p>\n<h3 id=\"securitymalware\">Malware</h3>\n<p>Malware is software that is intended to damage or disable computers and computer systems. For a website, this usually means software that is left on your website, usually in a file on your server. It&#8217;s software that is left there without your knowledge. If you find an alert in Bing Webmaster Tools about malware on your website, you should clean your site as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Bing Webmaster Tools divides the malware into two categories: malware found on the page and malware reference found on the page. In the first case, there is an immediate issue to be solved on the page with the listed URL, in the second case, there is a resource linked on the page at that URL that has malware. The page itself isn&#8217;t infected in that last case.</p>\n<p>Bing Webmaster Tools lists a couple of malware issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Malware Network Reference</strong>: any trace of a known malware distribution network is detected on your website.</li>\n<li><strong>Browser Exploit</strong>: malicious browser exploit detected, which may cause unsolicited execution of external code.</li>\n<li><strong>Malicious JavaScript</strong>: in a page or one of its attached script of frames, malicious JavaScript is detected (f.i. a spammy redirect).</li>\n<li><strong>Malicious ActiveX</strong>: ActiveX interactions seem to trigger malicious activity.</li>\n<li><strong>Heapspray</strong>: Bing detected a potential preparation for a browser exploit via a heapspray.  <em>Heapspraying</em> is a technique used in exploits to facilitate arbitrary code execution.</li>\n<li><strong>Malware Found on Adjacent Pages</strong>: URL is in a folder or subdomain containing malware.</li>\n<li><strong>Malware Reported by External Source</strong>: external sources reported that malware, obviously.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://yoast.com/out/sucuri\">Sucuri</a> is our and your friend in this. Hire these guys to clean up your site. After that, you want to address the vulnerability that allowed the malware to be installed. Simply <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/sucuri-scanner/\">download the Sucuri plugin</a> and follow their step by step instructions and guidance on how to secure your website (sections <em>Hardening</em> and <em>Post-Hack</em> in that plugin).</p>\n<p>And only after this, you should Request a Review in Bing Webmaster Tools to have them check again for the presence of malware.</p>\n<h3 id=\"securitytrackcertificates\">Track Certificates <sup>beta</sup></h3>\n<p>Yet another beta in Bing Webmaster Tools: Track Certificates. This page will tell you all about the certificates that were requested by people visiting your site. The main purpose of that list is so you&#8217;ll be able to spot unexpected or suspicious certificates, so you can report them to Microsoft using the Report link.</p>\n<p>This will also include security certificates like the ones we have on our website:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-342588 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-track-certificates-550x163.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Track Certificates\" width=\"550\" height=\"163\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"malware\">Widgets</h2>\n<p>In their competition struggle with Google, Bing has released a number of additions for your website that should make your life better. Two of these are in Bing Webmaster Tools and we&#8217;ll discuss both briefly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"knowledgewidget\">Knowledge Widget <sup>beta</sup></h3>\n<p>Bing <a href=\"http://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2014/06/19/bing-knowledge-comes-to-webmaster-tools/\">explains the knowledge widget</a> like this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For the first time, we empowered every webmaster to use the entity data from the Bing Knowledge repository. Since then, webmasters have added the embed code to thousands of pages to enhance their websites with the rich entity information from the Bing Knowledge system.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yes, the Bing Knowledge information is similar to the Knowledge Graph in Google (Bing added it first, by the way). It&#8217;s a separate block of content but now on your website itself! It works really simple: while the visitor goes over your website, the widget detects related entities in real time, marking them with a little <a href=\"http://blogs.microsoft.com/firehose/2014/01/06/new-bing-knowledge-widget-enhances-your-website-using-entity-data/\">Bing charm</a>. Now I do understand the social value, but feel that this is a bit like the pop-up ads in texts / on links that were briefly popular a couple of years ago. But hey, I might be wrong. Bing tells us that this is improving engagement, time-on-site, and user satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Adding the widget is simple: add your URL, copy the provided code and paste it for instance right before the &lt;/body&gt; tag in your template. Options are available for displaying images, images and links, just links. Besides that, there is an option to only activate the Bing Knowledge information on text selection by a user. It looks like this (example from Bing itself):</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-342597 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-knowledge-widget-550x404.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Knowledge Widget\" width=\"550\" height=\"404\" /></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a collapsible sidebar on your website.</p>\n<p><em>At the moment of writing, this is only available for English entities.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"translatorwidget\">Translator Widget</h3>\n<p>This Translator Widget could be useful, and is similar to the Google Translate option that is on a lot of websites. It only requires a simple copy/paste action and you are good to go. There is even a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bing-translator/\">WordPress plugin</a> to help you out.</p>\n<p>You can set the language of your website, and tell Bing to automatically translate based upon the visitor&#8217;s browser language, or have the visitor pick the language himself.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not a big fan of these widgets, Google or Bing. I understand that these are &#8216;convenient&#8217;, but rather see people putting some effort (or money) in a decent translation.

We have compared Bing Webmaster Tools to Google Webmaster Tools a couple of times during these four posts. Is that a fair comparison? For me it was like having Skippy sandwiches every day and then trying a jar of Peanut Butter &amp; Co. It&#8217;s different, but the same product. One could say variety is the spice of life, but in this case I tend stick to Google Webmaster Tools for the larger scale and user base, although the <a title=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Diagnostics &amp; Tools\" href=\"https://yoast.com/bing-webmaster-tools-diagnostics-tools/\">Markup Validator</a> tool in Bing Webmaster Tools will come in handy now and then for quick checks!</p>\n<p><em>For more reading on Webmaster Tools, please find <a href=\"https://yoast.com/tag/webmaster-tools/\">all our related articles here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>This post first appeared as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yoast.com/bing-webmaster-tools-security-widgets/\">Bing Webmaster Tools: Security, Widgets and Messages</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yoast.com\">Yoast</a>.

One could say variety is the spice of life, but in this case I tend stick to Google Webmaster Tools for the larger scale and user base, although the <a title=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Diagnostics &amp; Tools\" href=\"https://yoast.com/bing-webmaster-tools-diagnostics-tools/\">Markup Validator</a> tool in Bing Webmaster Tools will come in handy now and then for quick checks!</p>\n<p><em>For more reading on Webmaster Tools, please find <a href=\"https://yoast.com/tag/webmaster-tools/\">all our related articles here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>This post first appeared as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yoast.com/bing-webmaster-tools-security-widgets/\">Bing Webmaster Tools: Security, Widgets and Messages</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yoast.com\">Yoast</a>.

Somehow, they managed to squeeze these into one page in Bing Webmaster Tools as the dashboard page for the section <em>Diagnostics &amp; Tools</em>. Fortunately, all tools also have a separate page&#8230;<br />\nIn this post, we will go over all tools and tell you how to use these to your advantage.</p>\n<p>This is already our third article on Bing Webmaster Tools. In case you have missed the first two, go read these here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://yoast.com/bing-webmaster-tools-configure-site/\">Bing Webmaster Tools: Configure my site</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://yoast.com/bing-webmaster-tools-reports-data/\">Bing Webmaster Tools: Reports &amp; Data</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"keywordresearch\">Keyword Research <sup>beta</sup></h2>\n<p>Out of the five tools described in this article, Bing classifies most as &#8216;beta&#8217;. With all these tools, we also have to keep in mind that we are dealing with data from organic search at Bing. Let&#8217;s start with the Keyword Research tool:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-341035 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-keyword-research-550x167.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Keyword Research\" width=\"550\" height=\"167\" /></p>\n<p>I have tested this tool using a number of WordPress SEO related keywords for our website. As you can see, you can set a country and language, as well as a time frame from your research. I chose the US, US English and changed the default last 30 days to January 2015. Note that, as with Google Webmaster Tools, there is a gap between today and the end of your data; Bing Webmaster Tools goes up to 3 days ago.</p>\n<p>The tiny &#8216;Strict&#8217; option in there is to determine whether you want the research to be done for exact phrases or phrases containing the keyword. As I&#8217;d like to investigate general keywords (<em>WordPress, plugin, seo</em>), I have left this option unchecked:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-341063 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-keyword-planner-550x334.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Keyword Planner\" width=\"550\" height=\"334\" /></p>\n<p>All results can be sorted, by the way. Just click the (blue) title of a column. First thing that comes to mind is that the Google Keyword Planner shows 550K searches for WordPress in January 2015. Bing Webmaster Tools shows 60K. We&#8217;ve already mentioned that the search volume in Google&#8217;s keyword planner <a href=\"https://yoast.com/keyword-research-tools/\">isn&#8217;t always useful</a>, and the same must apply to these Bing numbers.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-341066\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-buy-keyword.png\" alt=\"Buy Keyword\" width=\"352\" height=\"222\" />The $-icon behind the keyword is a hint. You can actually buy the keyword here directly. That&#8217;s pretty straightforward :)</p>\n<p>I still feel that if you properly <a title=\"Optimize your WordPress site\" href=\"https://yoast.com/ebooks/optimize-wordpress-site/\">optimize your website</a>, you can get more clicks as well from organic results. Not trying to ruin your revenue model here, Bing. Paid results seem to work fine if you have narrowed down your niche and target these specific visitors. If the ad / paid result tells me what I need (to know), I&#8217;ll click it without a doubt.</p>\n<p>In the first table, you see search volume and trends. These are not just going up, by the way :) If you choose a longer period of time, it also won&#8217;t be just a straight line :) It will tell you what the rise or drop in search volume is as well.</p>\n<p>You can click all the results, but doing so will just filter the results, it won&#8217;t give you more details. By the way, just to be complete, you must have seen the Suggestions as well in the screenshots above. These keywords are additional keywords, related to your original keyword by relevancy.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a nice tool, but being used to the <a href=\"https://yoast.com/keyword-research-tools/\">keyword tools we normally use</a>, this isn&#8217;t one I&#8217;ll use very often. Perhaps the release version will have some features that will make it more attractive?</p>\n<h2 id=\"linkexplorer\">Link Explorer</h2>\n<p>This is Bing&#8217;s alternative for <a href=\"http://majesticseo.com\">MajesticSEO</a>, <a href=\"https://moz.com/researchtools/ose/\">OpenSiteExplorer</a> and more backlink tools like that. It allows you to find all backlinks known to Bing for any site. It has a few filters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Filter by site: only pages on your website linking to that URL.</li>\n<li>Anchor text: only links that use this anchor text.</li>\n<li>Additional query: only pages that link and that rank for the search keyword as well.</li>\n<li>Scope: links to the URL entered only or all pages from that domain.</li>\n<li>Source: only links from the site at hand (internal) or all links to that URL (external).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For that last one, you probably want to use the <a href=\"https://yoast.com/bing-webmaster-tools-reports-data/#inboundlinks\">inbound link tool at Reports &amp; Data</a> instead. It&#8217;s more comprehensive and for instance provides you with the exact anchor text for each link.</p>\n<p>The result of the Link Explorer tool is something like this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-341091 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-link-explorer-550x176.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Link Explorer\" width=\"550\" height=\"176\" /></p>\n<p>Clicking the Source URL will perform a link analysis in Bing Webmaster Tools for that domain, clicking the title will get you to the website itself.</p>\n<p>What I am missing here is total search volumes, and some more details on the domain. MajesticSEO adds Trust and Citation flow, Moz&#8217; OpenSiteExplorer adds both page and domain authority. Right now, the filters are what making this section on Bing Webmaster Tools interesting, not per se the (outcome of the) general exploration. if I wanted to check all the pages that link to our domain using &#8220;WordPress plugins&#8221;, this tool works fine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fetchasbingbot\">Fetch as Bingbot <sup>beta</sup></h2>\n<p>Like <a href=\"https://yoast.com/google-webmaster-tools-crawl/#fetch\">Fetch as Google</a>, this will tell you how the search engine bot sees your website. Simply enter your URL and click Fetch:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-341098 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-fetch-as-bingbot-550x146.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Fetch as Bingbot\" width=\"550\" height=\"146\" /></p>\n<p>After the fetch is done, status will change from Pending to Completed. Now you can click the Status and see how Bing sees your website (clicking the URL will simply get you to the page itself). Where Google Webmaster Tools actually renders your website as well, Bing displays the server response and your source code, as seen by Bingbot, of course. It will tell you if a page is redirected, or blocked by your robots.txt, for example.</p>\n<h2 id=\"markupvalidator\">Markup Validator <sup>beta</sup></h2>\n<p>I really like this one, to be honest. As it is totally unrelated to search traffic in terms of volume, this tools is a nice substitute for <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/\">Google&#8217;s Rich Snippet Test tool</a>. I don&#8217;t know if it is just getting used to something new, but I liked the clean setup of that Google tool like it was a few weeks ago. Bing tells me just what I need to know; is schema.org implemented correctly?</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-341803 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-schema1.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Rich Snippets Test\" width=\"488\" height=\"181\" /></p>\n<p>It is. It will also tell you about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa\">RDFa</a>, which you still want to use for breadcrumbs, for instance. Nice extra is that this Bing Webmaster tool also extracts the <a href=\"http://ogp.me/\">OpenGraph</a> data.</p>\n<p>And yes, I understand the new Google test tool explains what is wrong (according to Google, that is*), but if you just want to see what schema.org / RDFa / OpenGraph is on a page, this tool actually works just fine!</p>\n<p><em>* The Rich Snippet Test tool keeps on telling me to link the last element in my breadcrumbs, but why should I link to the page the visitor is already on? From a UX stand, that seems odd&#8230;</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"seoanalyzer\">SEO Analyzer <sup>beta</sup></h2>\n<p>There we go: Bing Webmaster Tools gives you a free SEO analyzer to cover all the basics (for more in depth analysis, check our <a href=\"https://yoast.com/hire-us/website-review/gold-seo-review/\">site reviews</a>).</p>\n<p>You can simply insert a URL and see what basics can be improved. This is very much like the <a href=\"https://yoast.com/google-webmaster-tools-search-appearance/#htmlimprovements\">HTML Improvements</a> in Google Webmaster Tools. There is also some overlap with the SEO Reports in Bing Webmaster Tools, but the SEO analyzer is a single page analyzing tool.</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-341801 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-seo-analyzer-overview-550x197.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: SEO Analyzer\" width=\"550\" height=\"197\" /></p>\n<p>It will tell you if H1&#8217;s are missing, which images lack ALT tags and for instance if a page is missing language information. I especially like the way it is displayed, with a direct reference to the &#8216;error&#8217; on the Analyzed tab on the right:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-341806 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-analyzed-tab-550x194.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Missing ALT tag\" width=\"550\" height=\"194\" /></p>\n<p>Two things to keep in mind when using the SEO Analyzer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SEO Analyzer, unlike Bingbot, will ignore robots.txt directives, so you can basically check any page on your site.</li>\n<li>SEO Analyzer follows any redirect and analyzes the page it end up on. It will tell you that a redirect is detected and followed (right below the SEO Suggestions).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"verifybingbottool\">Verify Bingbot Tool</h2>\n<p>So why would you want to know what IP address the Bingbot is? Well, the Bingbot might be &#8216;overcrawling&#8217; your website, unintendedly sending more than the usual server load your way. With this tool, you can verify if the IP address that is causing this load, is indeed Bingbot, which is needed for your <a href=\"https://support.discoverbing.com/eform.aspx?productKey=bingwebmaster&amp;ct=eformts&amp;scrx=1\">support request</a>. By the way, Bing does respect that crawl-delay line in your robots.txt. That might already help.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that this tools should be incorporated in a workload. The fact that it is displayed here as a separate section, seems a bit too much honor for that tool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sitemove\">Site Move</h2>\n<p>If you are moving your site to a new domain, be sure to let Bing Webmaster Tools know. It&#8217;s pretty easy:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding alignnone wp-image-341878 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-site-move-550x173.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Site Move\" width=\"550\" height=\"173\" /></p>\n<p>Just make sure both sites are verified. This can be done for entire domains, subdomains and directories. If you are moving a larger part of your website, like yoast.com/plugins to yoast.com/wp-plugins, this is also the section where you can see if all went well. <em>Note that this is just a notification, it has nothing to do with actually moving a site or directory.</em></p>\n<h2>That&#8217;s section three of Bing Webmaster Tools</h2>\n<p>When comparing Bing Webmaster Tools to Google Webmaster Tools (and of course we do), this section holds some nice surprises. As mentioned, I like the simplicity of the Rich Snippet test, and the way the SEO Analyzer highlights the improvements on your page.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in our earlier posts, I&#8217;d never replace Google Webmaster Tools entirely by Bing Webmaster Tools, but a combination of might have its benefits. In the next post in this series, we will cover the remaining three sections of Bing Webmaster Tools we&#8217;d like to discuss: Security, Widgets and Messages.</p>\n<p>This post first appeared as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yoast.com/bing-webmaster-tools-diagnostics-tools/\">Bing Webmaster Tools: Diagnostics &#038; Tools</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yoast.com\">Yoast</a>.

It will tell you that a redirect is detected and followed (right below the SEO Suggestions).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"verifybingbottool\">Verify Bingbot Tool</h2>\n<p>So why would you want to know what IP address the Bingbot is? Well, the Bingbot might be &#8216;overcrawling&#8217; your website, unintendedly sending more than the usual server load your way. With this tool, you can verify if the IP address that is causing this load, is indeed Bingbot, which is needed for your <a href=\"https://support.discoverbing.com/eform.aspx?productKey=bingwebmaster&amp;ct=eformts&amp;scrx=1\">support request</a>. By the way, Bing does respect that crawl-delay line in your robots.txt. That might already help.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that this tools should be incorporated in a workload. The fact that it is displayed here as a separate section, seems a bit too much honor for that tool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sitemove\">Site Move</h2>\n<p>If you are moving your site to a new domain, be sure to let Bing Webmaster Tools know. It&#8217;s pretty easy:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding alignnone wp-image-341878 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-site-move-550x173.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Site Move\" width=\"550\" height=\"173\" /></p>\n<p>Just make sure both sites are verified. This can be done for entire domains, subdomains and directories. If you are moving a larger part of your website, like yoast.com/plugins to yoast.com/wp-plugins, this is also the section where you can see if all went well. <em>Note that this is just a notification, it has nothing to do with actually moving a site or directory.</em></p>\n<h2>That&#8217;s section three of Bing Webmaster Tools</h2>\n<p>When comparing Bing Webmaster Tools to Google Webmaster Tools (and of course we do), this section holds some nice surprises. As mentioned, I like the simplicity of the Rich Snippet test, and the way the SEO Analyzer highlights the improvements on your page.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in our earlier posts, I&#8217;d never replace Google Webmaster Tools entirely by Bing Webmaster Tools, but a combination of might have its benefits. In the next post in this series, we will cover the remaining three sections of Bing Webmaster Tools we&#8217;d like to discuss: Security, Widgets and Messages.</p>\n<p>This post first appeared as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yoast.com/bing-webmaster-tools-diagnostics-tools/\">Bing Webmaster Tools: Diagnostics &#038; Tools</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yoast.com\">Yoast</a>.

We&#8217;ll be going over a number of pages, and try to explain what information is available and how this can help you improve your website. Or get new insights about your audience, of course. This section is called: <strong>Reports and Data</strong>.</p>\n<p>Note that although we very much like the &#8216;broader&#8217; setup of Bing Webmaster Tools, I personally tend to use Google Webmaster Tools first for one simple reason. Google dominates the search engine market. There is data from much more users in Google Webmaster Tools. Having said that, there are a lot of things in Bing Webmaster Tools that could be used to further improve Google Webmaster Tools. Now let&#8217;s go over the different chapters in this section of Bing Webmaster Tools.</p>\n<h2 id=\"siteactivity\">Site activity</h2>\n<p>As you can see in the graph below (upper right corner), Bing Webmaster Tools combines data from Yahoo! and Bing for these stats. It also painfully highlights the difference in use of the webmaster tools: as you can see, our website gets around 80 clicks a day from Bing and Yahoo!, compared to about 9,000 clicks on average per day from Google.</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-338108 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-site-activity-550x246.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Site Activity\" width=\"550\" height=\"246\" /></p>\n<p>In the chart, you can also choose to show a number of other things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clicks from Search</li>\n<li>Appeared in Search</li>\n<li>Pages Crawled</li>\n<li>Crawl Errors</li>\n<li>Total Pages indexed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s nice to align the number of pages crawled and the crawl errors, but as with most graphs like this, it&#8217;s the trend that matter the most to me here. If all of a sudden the graph flatlines at zero (except at the crawl errors), there must be something wrong.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pagetraffic\">Page Traffic</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the main table here:<br />\n<img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-338125 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-page-traffic-550x470.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Page Traffic\" width=\"550\" height=\"470\" /><br />\nThere is a lot going on here, right? All the arrows and numbers tell you what happened with for instance the Clicks from Search, and how often you appeared in search. For your convenience, Bing has divided the clicks by the appearances, giving you the click-through rate (CTR).</p>\n<p>The average search click position tells you the position your result was when clicked, on average. The trend is key here. If the average position gets closer to #1, you know you are doing well, as your page is increasing it&#8217;s ranking for &#8216;that&#8217; search term. This highlights the main issue: you need to combine this with the Search Keywords in the last column to be useful. Just click <em>View</em>, as Bing Webmaster Tools presents these keywords in a convenient popup:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-338131 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-traffic-details-550x305.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Traffic Details\" width=\"550\" height=\"305\" /></p>\n<p><em>Who&#8217;s &#8216;youst&#8217;, right?</em> I can&#8217;t get used to that downwards pointing arrow with a number, it&#8217;s like we dropped 675 clicks. But that&#8217;s not what is meant. We had 675 clicks from Bing search result pages to our homepage where the search keyword was &#8216;yoast&#8217;, and that is a drop from the beginning of the selected time period.</p>\n<p>This is also where you can check the performance per position in the search result pages. Just click the &#8216;+&#8217; in front of the keyword:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-338134 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-traffic-details-position-550x114.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Traffic Details, positions\" width=\"550\" height=\"114\" /></p>\n<p>Back to the main table for your Page Traffic. The last column we haven&#8217;t mentioned yet is Average Search Appearance Position. In most if not all cases, this number is higher than the average click position, simply because we all know the higher the position, the more clicks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"indexexplorer\">Index Explorer</h2>\n<p>This is your Mac Finder or Windows Explorer for all things Bing found in your website or site&#8217;s structure. It&#8217;s how Bing sees your site. You can see files Bing considers 301 Redirects or 404 Error pages, for instance. There are a number of filters here, listed as the blue links below. Next to that, you can use some custom options:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-338141 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-index-explorer-550x365.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Index Explorer, robots.txt\" width=\"550\" height=\"365\" /></p>\n<p>Strange thing is that our robots.txt is actually <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress-robots-txt-example/\">updated a while ago already</a>. Where Google tends to find these updates within a day, sometimes hour, Bing still shows some old content in here. We re-fetched the robots.txt during the writing of this article, just to make sure. The fetch shows the current content of our robots.txt. I&#8217;m sure Bing Webmaster Tools will find that eventually.</p>\n<h2 id=\"searchkeywords\">Search Keywords</h2>\n<p>Much like the Page Traffic table, this table shows you the number of clicks from search results in Bing, as well as all other things explained <a href=\"#pagetraffic\">there</a>. It are keywords instead of URLs in this table, but that is the main difference.</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-338156 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-search-keywords-550x167.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Search Keywords\" width=\"550\" height=\"167\" /></p>\n<p>As you can see, that last column is different. You can view the pages instead of keywords (at Page Traffic). So it&#8217;s basically the same table, but the other way around :) Use to your preference, so to speak.</p>\n<h2 id=\"seoreports\">SEO Reports</h2>\n<p>Why <a href=\"https://yoast.com/hire-us/website-review/\">order a site review</a> when you have Bing SEO Reports. [promo] Well, for one thing, we tell you much more about stuff from speed to design, from content to social. [/promo] Bing SEO Reports in beta, but does provide some nice insights. We need to work on our meta descriptions, according to this overview:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-338163 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-seo-reports-550x293.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: SEO Reports\" width=\"550\" height=\"293\" /></p>\n<p>I especially like the fact that Bing tells you how they consider these suggestions to influence your SEO. Bing agrees with Google that meta descriptions are like invites to your website that should have a clear message about the contents of the page and tells that the severity of these meta descriptions is high. The fact that the meta description is missing, isn&#8217;t bad* per se, but it&#8217;s good to know where these are missing. You can easily click the suggestion title to find the pages these should be added.</p>\n<p>Bing Webmaster Tools has taken the time to add a proper explanation to all these suggestions:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-338171 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-meta-description-550x207.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: SEO Analysis Detail\" width=\"550\" height=\"207\" /></p>\n<p>If you click one of the (50, it&#8217;s limited to that) links on that Detail page, you&#8217;ll be taken to a SEO Analyzer (also in beta). More on that SEO Analyzer in our next post on Bing Webmaster Tools.</p>\n<aside id=\"aside\"></p>\n<p>On a side note, I had a quick word via Twitter with the guys at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HelpScoutDev\">@helscoutdev</a> and this is what they replied:</p>\n<p><em>We don&#8217;t set the language because not all sites are in English. Multi-language support is on the list, will consider then.</em></p>\n<p>FYI :)</p>\n<p></aside>\n<p>It seems our knowledge base &#8211; we&#8217;re using <a href=\"http://www.helpscout.net/features/docs/\">HelpScout&#8217;s awesome Docs</a> &#8211; is missing meta language information. I can imagine that being so due to their global user base. In that case it&#8217;s a good thing language isn&#8217;t templated.</p>\n<p>All in all, this is a very useful section you can use for some basic SEO check of your website.</p>\n<p><em>* in case you can&#8217;t come up with a proper <a title=\"How to create the right meta description\" href=\"https://yoast.com/meta-descriptions/\">meta description</a>, let Bing (or Google) decide. Both will create a meta description that in most cases is constructed from a text snippet containing the keyword used in search. This can be beneficial for conversion, as you will understand.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"inboundlinks\">Inbound Links</h2>\n<p>Again, the details make this a useful section. On the dashboard page of this section, the total number of inbound links (links to your website), doesn&#8217;t say much, unless there is a break in the trend. Right below the graph, you&#8217;ll find target pages. Clicking one of these gives you an overview of the pages linking your specific page:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-338205 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-link-details-550x264.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Link details\" width=\"550\" height=\"264\" /></p>\n<p>As you can see, this includes the anchor text. There are up to 20,000 external pages listed. As the popup isn&#8217;t suitable for that number of links, the export option in the upper right of the popup comes in really handy for further analysis. Bing Webmaster Tools offers that export option on almost all pages, by the way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"crawlinformation\">Crawl Information</h2>\n<p>This is a quick overview of error codes (like 404, 502), Redirects (301, 302), DNS failures, connection timeouts and robots.txt exclusions. All is grouped per category:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-338342 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-crawl-information-550x227.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Crawl Information\" width=\"550\" height=\"227\" /></p>\n<p>Click the row marked with * in Bing Webmaster Tools to find all URLs that resulted in that error, are redirected, etc. It&#8217;s nice to see if all pages you have excluded are indeed excluded, for instance. Clicking a link in this table isn&#8217;t providing more information, but gets you to the page at hand to check f.i. if the error or redirect still exists. As mentioned right above the table, Bing refers you to the Index Explorer for more details. It would be nice if I could mark a 404 as fixed here, by the way (in case any of the Bing people reads this).</p>\n<h2 id=\"malware\">Malware</h2>\n<p>Score.</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding alignnone wp-image-338348 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-malware.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Malware\" width=\"296\" height=\"114\" /></p>\n<p>In case Bing detects any malware on your website, it will list the URLs of potentially infected pages here.<br />\nMalware (short for malicious software) is &#8220;any software used to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems.&#8221; (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware\">Wikipedia</a>). Of course you don&#8217;t want that on your website.</p>\n<p>In the unwanted case you have some URLs listed here, fix the malware or have our friends at <a href=\"https://yoast.com/out/sucuri\">Sucuri</a> clean this up, and Request a Review via this same section in Bing Webmaster Tools.</p>\n<h2>That concludes this section in Bing Webmaster Tools</h2>\n<p>To round things up, the Reports &amp; Data section in Bing Webmaster Tools gives you a lot to work with.

You can easily click the suggestion title to find the pages these should be added.</p>\n<p>Bing Webmaster Tools has taken the time to add a proper explanation to all these suggestions:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-338171 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-meta-description-550x207.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: SEO Analysis Detail\" width=\"550\" height=\"207\" /></p>\n<p>If you click one of the (50, it&#8217;s limited to that) links on that Detail page, you&#8217;ll be taken to a SEO Analyzer (also in beta). More on that SEO Analyzer in our next post on Bing Webmaster Tools.</p>\n<aside id=\"aside\"></p>\n<p>On a side note, I had a quick word via Twitter with the guys at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HelpScoutDev\">@helscoutdev</a> and this is what they replied:</p>\n<p><em>We don&#8217;t set the language because not all sites are in English. Multi-language support is on the list, will consider then.</em></p>\n<p>FYI :)</p>\n<p></aside>\n<p>It seems our knowledge base &#8211; we&#8217;re using <a href=\"http://www.helpscout.net/features/docs/\">HelpScout&#8217;s awesome Docs</a> &#8211; is missing meta language information. I can imagine that being so due to their global user base. In that case it&#8217;s a good thing language isn&#8217;t templated.</p>\n<p>All in all, this is a very useful section you can use for some basic SEO check of your website.</p>\n<p><em>* in case you can&#8217;t come up with a proper <a title=\"How to create the right meta description\" href=\"https://yoast.com/meta-descriptions/\">meta description</a>, let Bing (or Google) decide. Both will create a meta description that in most cases is constructed from a text snippet containing the keyword used in search. This can be beneficial for conversion, as you will understand.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"inboundlinks\">Inbound Links</h2>\n<p>Again, the details make this a useful section. On the dashboard page of this section, the total number of inbound links (links to your website), doesn&#8217;t say much, unless there is a break in the trend. Right below the graph, you&#8217;ll find target pages. Clicking one of these gives you an overview of the pages linking your specific page:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-338205 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-link-details-550x264.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Link details\" width=\"550\" height=\"264\" /></p>\n<p>As you can see, this includes the anchor text. There are up to 20,000 external pages listed. As the popup isn&#8217;t suitable for that number of links, the export option in the upper right of the popup comes in really handy for further analysis. Bing Webmaster Tools offers that export option on almost all pages, by the way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"crawlinformation\">Crawl Information</h2>\n<p>This is a quick overview of error codes (like 404, 502), Redirects (301, 302), DNS failures, connection timeouts and robots.txt exclusions. All is grouped per category:</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-338342 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-crawl-information-550x227.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Crawl Information\" width=\"550\" height=\"227\" /></p>\n<p>Click the row marked with * in Bing Webmaster Tools to find all URLs that resulted in that error, are redirected, etc. It&#8217;s nice to see if all pages you have excluded are indeed excluded, for instance. Clicking a link in this table isn&#8217;t providing more information, but gets you to the page at hand to check f.i. if the error or redirect still exists. As mentioned right above the table, Bing refers you to the Index Explorer for more details. It would be nice if I could mark a 404 as fixed here, by the way (in case any of the Bing people reads this).</p>\n<h2 id=\"malware\">Malware</h2>\n<p>Score.</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding alignnone wp-image-338348 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bwt-malware.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools: Malware\" width=\"296\" height=\"114\" /></p>\n<p>In case Bing detects any malware on your website, it will list the URLs of potentially infected pages here.<br />\nMalware (short for malicious software) is &#8220;any software used to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems.&#8221; (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware\">Wikipedia</a>). Of course you don&#8217;t want that on your website.</p>\n<p>In the unwanted case you have some URLs listed here, fix the malware or have our friends at <a href=\"https://yoast.com/out/sucuri\">Sucuri</a> clean this up, and Request a Review via this same section in Bing Webmaster Tools.</p>\n<h2>That concludes this section in Bing Webmaster Tools</h2>\n<p>To round things up, the Reports &amp; Data section in Bing Webmaster Tools gives you a lot to work with.

So we thought it was time to do a series about Bing Webmaster Tools as well. Bing isn&#8217;t that big in The Netherlands, or Europe, for that matter, but it still holds some ground in the US. The most important reason, however, is we think Bing Webmaster Tools is pretty awesome. It offers some really nice tools and details you, unfortunately, won&#8217;t find in Google Webmaster Tools (anymore).</p>\n<p>In this post we&#8217;ll go into the first main menu item of Bing Webmaster Tools and its subitems. But first, we&#8217;ll explain how you can set it up for your own site!</p>\n<h2 id=\"setup-bwt\">Setting up Bing Webmaster Tools</h2>\n<p>Since Bing Webmaster Tools is probably less known than its Google counterpart, we&#8217;ll let you know how to set it up! So lets start with the beginning.</p>\n<h3 id=\"live-account\">You need a Microsoft Live account</h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry, this doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ll need an @outlook.com or @hotmail.com email address. You can actually use any email address you like. Go here to <a href=\"https://signup.live.com/signup.aspx?lic=1\">sign up for a Live account</a> and just follow the steps.</p>\n<p>Once you have a Live account, you can go to <a href=\"http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster\">Bing Webmaster Tools</a> and sign in with the account you just created.</p>\n<h3 id=\"add-site\">Add your site</h3>\n<p>After logging in to your Bing Webmaster Tools, you obviously need to add your site:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-338055 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/My_Sites_-_Bing_Webmaster_Tools.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools - Add your site\" width=\"457\" height=\"122\" /></p>\n<p>Fill in your website&#8217;s URL here and click ADD. This will take you to this screen:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-338056 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Add_a_Site_-_Bing_Webmaster_Tools.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools - Add your site and sitemap\" width=\"546\" height=\"311\" /></p>\n<p>If you already have a sitemap and you&#8217;re aware of it, you can fill in the sitemap here as well. We recommend just leaving the last option on the default, for now. Now you can click the &#8220;ADD&#8221; button again. Doing this will take you to the following screen:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-338058 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Verify_ownership_for__yoast_com_-_Bing_Webmaster_Tools.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools - Verify ownership\" width=\"672\" height=\"731\" /></p>\n<p>And this is where the fun comes in. All of this might seem very technical and way over your head. However, if you&#8217;re using our <a title=\"WordPress SEO Plugin\" href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/\">WordPress SEO plugin</a>, this is all very easy. Simply copy the entire part in the grey bar and paste it in our plugin here:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-338064 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WordPress_SEO_-_Setting_up_Bing_Webmaster_Tools.png\" alt=\"WordPress SEO Setting up Bing Webmaster Tools\" width=\"771\" height=\"378\" /></p>\n<p>Hit &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; and it&#8217;ll remove everything it won&#8217;t need, just your &#8216;key&#8217; will remain. After that hit verify back in the Bing Webmaster Tools setup. If you have some caching, this might not work instantaneously; clear your cache or wait for a bit until you can verify it.</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve verified it, you&#8217;ll be able to access your Bing Webmaster Tools!</p>\n<h2 id=\"configure\">Configure My Site</h2>\n<p>When clicking the &#8216;Configure My Site&#8217; menu item, you&#8217;ll be taken to a dashboard overview of all that you can do in this menu item. You can even do most things right there in the dashboard, which makes it the go to place, once you know what it all does ;)</p>\n<p>So lets get to explaining what you can play with in Bing Webmaster Tools.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sitemaps\">Sitemaps</h3>\n<p>The sitemaps menu item is about just that: sitemaps. Here you can (re)submit, remove or export sitemaps. Adding a sitemap is simple, just copy the sitemap&#8217;s URL, paste it in the appropriate bar and hit Submit. As with Google, if you have multiple sitemaps under a sitemap index (as our WordPress SEO plugin does for you), you just have to add the sitemap index.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve added a sitemap index, just clicking that index sitemap&#8217;s link will take you to all underlying sitemaps. You can also see whether any errors occurred when crawling your sitemap, when it was last crawled and how many URLs were submitted through the sitemaps, for instance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"submit-urls\">Submit URLs</h3>\n<p>In this section you can add URLs of pages that you think are important directly into the Bing index. This feature is limited to 10 links a day and 50 links a month per domain. Whether this actually makes sure your content is indexed more quickly than through your sitemaps, for instance, remains a bit unclear.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ignore-urls\">Ignore URL Parameters</h3>\n<p>URL Parameters are anything after the normal URL, so usually anything after a question mark in your URL. If you want Bing to ignore any of these parameters, you can tell them here. Just to be clear: this will ignore <em>only</em> the parameters, it&#8217;ll literally remove the parameters from the URL before adding the page to the index. So this does not mean any URLs with these parameters will not be indexed, you should do that in the Block URLs section.</p>\n<p>A URL with parameters is actually viewed as a different URL as the same one without parameters. So &#8220;https://yoast.com/?utm_source=&#8221; etc&#8230; would actually be considered a different URL than just &#8220;https://yoast.com/&#8221;, even though they end up at the same place. So using this feature can prevent duplicate content.</p>\n<h3 id=\"crawl-control\">Crawl Control</h3>\n<p>This is one of the more nifty tools in the Configure My Site section of Bing Webmaster Tools. You can tell Bing when to crawl your site more and when to crawl it less:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-338078 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Crawl_Control_-_Bing_Webmaster_Tools.png\" alt=\"Crawl Control Bing Webmaster Tools\" width=\"738\" height=\"342\" /></p>\n<p>They have some preset crawl rates, which are made to prevent an overload of your server. So when your site is busy, they&#8217;ll crawl your site less, and when it&#8217;s less busy, they&#8217;ll crawl more. However, you can also set a custom crawl rate. Just click in the graph to increase or decrease the crawl rate.</p>\n<p><em>Note: If you have any info on crawl rate specified in your robots.txt, that will take precedence over anything you set up here.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"deep-links\">Deep Links</h3>\n<p>Deep links are the Bing equivalent of Google&#8217;s Site Links. If you don&#8217;t know what those are either, they&#8217;re all the links in the pink block:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-338081 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/yoast_-_Bing.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools - Deep Links\" width=\"542\" height=\"309\" /></p>\n<p>In the Deep Links section you can block pages from showing up there. What&#8217;s nice about Bing here, is that they allow you to remove the URL showing as a deep link for all URLs, a specific URL or even for a specific country or region.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s not so nice about Bing here is that they limited this block to 90 days. The block can be extended, but that means you have to revisit your webmaster tools every 3 months to extend the block you set.</p>\n<h3 id=\"block-urls\">Block URLs</h3>\n<p>The Block URLs section is very similar to the Deep Links section, in that it blocks URLs from showing up in the Bing search results. Adding a URL here will block the URL from showing up <em>anywhere</em> in the search results of Bing, though.</p>\n<p>Annoyingly, they&#8217;ve again set the block to a maximum of 90 days, so you should only use this feature if you&#8217;ve just deleted a page from your site. Any permanent pages you want to block should be blocked in robots.txt.</p>\n<h3 id=\"preview\">Page Preview</h3>\n<p>The page preview is just that: a preview of your page. Bing doesn&#8217;t show this page preview everywhere, but they do in for example Bing Smart Search in Windows. You can tell Bing to refresh or remove the preview of a specific URL here. Just fill in the URL and click Fetch. You&#8217;ll then be given a choice to either block the preview or refresh it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"disavow\">Disavow Links</h3>\n<p>Here you can disavow links you got from other websites. If you don&#8217;t know what disavowing a link means, read the post by Michiel on <a title=\"Clean up your bad backlinks\" href=\"https://yoast.com/clean-bad-backlinks/\">cleaning up bad backlinks</a>. The best feature here by far is that you&#8217;re able to disavow not only a single page link, but also complete directories or domains. This can save you a lot of time when cleaning up your backlinks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"geo-targeting\">Geo-Targeting</h3>\n<p>In this section you can set a geo-targeting for your domain, subdomain, directory or page. Geo-targeting means you tell Bing the part of your website you selected is meant for a specific region or country. For instance, if we had a German version of yoast.com under yoast.com/de/, we&#8217;d set the geo-targeting for the yoast.com/de/ directory to Germany. This doesn&#8217;t mean it won&#8217;t show in Bing results in other countries, it just makes it more clear to Bing what people should be seeing the content.</p>\n<p>One note about this: although you can set geo-targeting for your domain, if your domain has a country-code (.nl, .de, .co.uk for instance), geo-targeting your entire domain won&#8217;t work. Directories and pages can still be geo-targeted.</p>\n<h3 id=\"verify-ownership\">Verify ownership</h3>\n<p>If you need to verify your website again, you can do so here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"connected-pages\">Connected Pages</h3>\n<p>Under Connected Pages you can tell Bing any social media presences you have elsewhere. By connecting these pages to Bing Webmaster Tools, you&#8217;ll be given quite some nice insights. For instance, we&#8217;re able to see how many times our twitter account appeared in search and how many times people clicked those appearances. We can even see what keywords people used to get our twitter account to appear, how many backlinks our twitter account (or status updates) has and what anchor texts were used for those links.</p>\n<h3 id=\"app-linking\">App Linking</h3>\n<p>Here you can link any apps you&#8217;ve connected in the Connected Pages section to Bing search results on Windows and Windows Phone. As we don&#8217;t have any experience with apps, I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on what this does exactly! ;)</p>\n<h3 id=\"users\">Users</h3>\n<p>Here you can manage the users that have access to Bing Webmaster Tools for the current site.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">What do you think?</h2>\n<p>Although Bing is definitely used less than Google, their Webmaster Tools are actually pretty awesome. So if Bing gives you a relevant amount of traffic to your site, it&#8217;s definitely something you should check out!</p>\n<p>Do you agree? Let me know in the comments!</p>\n<p>The next post on the next main menu item in Bing Webmaster Tools, written by Michiel, will be published tomorrow.</p>\n<p>This post first appeared as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yoast.com/bing-webmaster-tools-configure-site/\">Bing Webmaster Tools: Configure My Site</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yoast.com\">Yoast</a>.

So we thought it was time to do a series about Bing Webmaster Tools as well. Bing isn&#8217;t that big in The Netherlands, or Europe, for that matter, but it still holds some ground in the US. The most important reason, however, is we think Bing Webmaster Tools is pretty awesome. It offers some really nice tools and details you, unfortunately, won&#8217;t find in Google Webmaster Tools (anymore).</p>\n<p>In this post we&#8217;ll go into the first main menu item of Bing Webmaster Tools and its subitems. But first, we&#8217;ll explain how you can set it up for your own site!</p>\n<h2 id=\"setup-bwt\">Setting up Bing Webmaster Tools</h2>\n<p>Since Bing Webmaster Tools is probably less known than its Google counterpart, we&#8217;ll let you know how to set it up! So lets start with the beginning.</p>\n<h3 id=\"live-account\">You need a Microsoft Live account</h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry, this doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ll need an @outlook.com or @hotmail.com email address. You can actually use any email address you like. Go here to <a href=\"https://signup.live.com/signup.aspx?lic=1\">sign up for a Live account</a> and just follow the steps.</p>\n<p>Once you have a Live account, you can go to <a href=\"http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster\">Bing Webmaster Tools</a> and sign in with the account you just created.</p>\n<h3 id=\"add-site\">Add your site</h3>\n<p>After logging in to your Bing Webmaster Tools, you obviously need to add your site:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-338055 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/My_Sites_-_Bing_Webmaster_Tools.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools - Add your site\" width=\"457\" height=\"122\" /></p>\n<p>Fill in your website&#8217;s URL here and click ADD. This will take you to this screen:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-338056 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Add_a_Site_-_Bing_Webmaster_Tools.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools - Add your site and sitemap\" width=\"546\" height=\"311\" /></p>\n<p>If you already have a sitemap and you&#8217;re aware of it, you can fill in the sitemap here as well. We recommend just leaving the last option on the default, for now. Now you can click the &#8220;ADD&#8221; button again. Doing this will take you to the following screen:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-338058 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Verify_ownership_for__yoast_com_-_Bing_Webmaster_Tools.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools - Verify ownership\" width=\"672\" height=\"731\" /></p>\n<p>And this is where the fun comes in. All of this might seem very technical and way over your head. However, if you&#8217;re using our <a title=\"WordPress SEO Plugin\" href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/\">WordPress SEO plugin</a>, this is all very easy. Simply copy the entire part in the grey bar and paste it in our plugin here:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-338064 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WordPress_SEO_-_Setting_up_Bing_Webmaster_Tools.png\" alt=\"WordPress SEO Setting up Bing Webmaster Tools\" width=\"771\" height=\"378\" /></p>\n<p>Hit &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; and it&#8217;ll remove everything it won&#8217;t need, just your &#8216;key&#8217; will remain. After that hit verify back in the Bing Webmaster Tools setup. If you have some caching, this might not work instantaneously; clear your cache or wait for a bit until you can verify it.</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve verified it, you&#8217;ll be able to access your Bing Webmaster Tools!</p>\n<h2 id=\"configure\">Configure My Site</h2>\n<p>When clicking the &#8216;Configure My Site&#8217; menu item, you&#8217;ll be taken to a dashboard overview of all that you can do in this menu item. You can even do most things right there in the dashboard, which makes it the go to place, once you know what it all does ;)</p>\n<p>So lets get to explaining what you can play with in Bing Webmaster Tools.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sitemaps\">Sitemaps</h3>\n<p>The sitemaps menu item is about just that: sitemaps. Here you can (re)submit, remove or export sitemaps. Adding a sitemap is simple, just copy the sitemap&#8217;s URL, paste it in the appropriate bar and hit Submit. As with Google, if you have multiple sitemaps under a sitemap index (as our WordPress SEO plugin does for you), you just have to add the sitemap index.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve added a sitemap index, just clicking that index sitemap&#8217;s link will take you to all underlying sitemaps. You can also see whether any errors occurred when crawling your sitemap, when it was last crawled and how many URLs were submitted through the sitemaps, for instance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"submit-urls\">Submit URLs</h3>\n<p>In this section you can add URLs of pages that you think are important directly into the Bing index. This feature is limited to 10 links a day and 50 links a month per domain. Whether this actually makes sure your content is indexed more quickly than through your sitemaps, for instance, remains a bit unclear.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ignore-urls\">Ignore URL Parameters</h3>\n<p>URL Parameters are anything after the normal URL, so usually anything after a question mark in your URL. If you want Bing to ignore any of these parameters, you can tell them here. Just to be clear: this will ignore <em>only</em> the parameters, it&#8217;ll literally remove the parameters from the URL before adding the page to the index. So this does not mean any URLs with these parameters will not be indexed, you should do that in the Block URLs section.</p>\n<p>A URL with parameters is actually viewed as a different URL as the same one without parameters. So &#8220;https://yoast.com/?utm_source=&#8221; etc&#8230; would actually be considered a different URL than just &#8220;https://yoast.com/&#8221;, even though they end up at the same place. So using this feature can prevent duplicate content.</p>\n<h3 id=\"crawl-control\">Crawl Control</h3>\n<p>This is one of the more nifty tools in the Configure My Site section of Bing Webmaster Tools. You can tell Bing when to crawl your site more and when to crawl it less:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-338078 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Crawl_Control_-_Bing_Webmaster_Tools.png\" alt=\"Crawl Control Bing Webmaster Tools\" width=\"738\" height=\"342\" /></p>\n<p>They have some preset crawl rates, which are made to prevent an overload of your server. So when your site is busy, they&#8217;ll crawl your site less, and when it&#8217;s less busy, they&#8217;ll crawl more. However, you can also set a custom crawl rate. Just click in the graph to increase or decrease the crawl rate.</p>\n<p><em>Note: If you have any info on crawl rate specified in your robots.txt, that will take precedence over anything you set up here.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"deep-links\">Deep Links</h3>\n<p>Deep links are the Bing equivalent of Google&#8217;s Site Links. If you don&#8217;t know what those are either, they&#8217;re all the links in the pink block:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-338081 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/yoast_-_Bing.png\" alt=\"Bing Webmaster Tools - Deep Links\" width=\"542\" height=\"309\" /></p>\n<p>In the Deep Links section you can block pages from showing up there. What&#8217;s nice about Bing here, is that they allow you to remove the URL showing as a deep link for all URLs, a specific URL or even for a specific country or region.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s not so nice about Bing here is that they limited this block to 90 days. The block can be extended, but that means you have to revisit your webmaster tools every 3 months to extend the block you set.</p>\n<h3 id=\"block-urls\">Block URLs</h3>\n<p>The Block URLs section is very similar to the Deep Links section, in that it blocks URLs from showing up in the Bing search results. Adding a URL here will block the URL from showing up <em>anywhere</em> in the search results of Bing, though.</p>\n<p>Annoyingly, they&#8217;ve again set the block to a maximum of 90 days, so you should only use this feature if you&#8217;ve just deleted a page from your site. Any permanent pages you want to block should be blocked in robots.txt.</p>\n<h3 id=\"preview\">Page Preview</h3>\n<p>The page preview is just that: a preview of your page. Bing doesn&#8217;t show this page preview everywhere, but they do in for example Bing Smart Search in Windows. You can tell Bing to refresh or remove the preview of a specific URL here. Just fill in the URL and click Fetch. You&#8217;ll then be given a choice to either block the preview or refresh it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"disavow\">Disavow Links</h3>\n<p>Here you can disavow links you got from other websites. If you don&#8217;t know what disavowing a link means, read the post by Michiel on <a title=\"Clean up your bad backlinks\" href=\"https://yoast.com/clean-bad-backlinks/\">cleaning up bad backlinks</a>. The best feature here by far is that you&#8217;re able to disavow not only a single page link, but also complete directories or domains. This can save you a lot of time when cleaning up your backlinks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"geo-targeting\">Geo-Targeting</h3>\n<p>In this section you can set a geo-targeting for your domain, subdomain, directory or page. Geo-targeting means you tell Bing the part of your website you selected is meant for a specific region or country. For instance, if we had a German version of yoast.com under yoast.com/de/, we&#8217;d set the geo-targeting for the yoast.com/de/ directory to Germany. This doesn&#8217;t mean it won&#8217;t show in Bing results in other countries, it just makes it more clear to Bing what people should be seeing the content.</p>\n<p>One note about this: although you can set geo-targeting for your domain, if your domain has a country-code (.nl, .de, .co.uk for instance), geo-targeting your entire domain won&#8217;t work. Directories and pages can still be geo-targeted.</p>\n<h3 id=\"verify-ownership\">Verify ownership</h3>\n<p>If you need to verify your website again, you can do so here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"connected-pages\">Connected Pages</h3>\n<p>Under Connected Pages you can tell Bing any social media presences you have elsewhere. By connecting these pages to Bing Webmaster Tools, you&#8217;ll be given quite some nice insights. For instance, we&#8217;re able to see how many times our twitter account appeared in search and how many times people clicked those appearances. We can even see what keywords people used to get our twitter account to appear, how many backlinks our twitter account (or status updates) has and what anchor texts were used for those links.</p>\n<h3 id=\"app-linking\">App Linking</h3>\n<p>Here you can link any apps you&#8217;ve connected in the Connected Pages section to Bing search results on Windows and Windows Phone. As we don&#8217;t have any experience with apps, I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on what this does exactly! ;)</p>\n<h3 id=\"users\">Users</h3>\n<p>Here you can manage the users that have access to Bing Webmaster Tools for the current site.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">What do you think?</h2>\n<p>Although Bing is definitely used less than Google, their Webmaster Tools are actually pretty awesome. So if Bing gives you a relevant amount of traffic to your site, it&#8217;s definitely something you should check out!</p>\n<p>Do you agree?

Search engines use the <code>hreflang</code> tag to &#8216;redirect&#8217; the visitor to the page in the right language. Hreflang is also referred to as<code> rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"x\"</code>.</p>\n<p>When I was discussing post subjects with our site review team, Annelieke pointed out that <strong>hreflang</strong> was mentioned on our website, but that we never did an article about it. Perhaps that is because for most sites, hreflang isn&#8217;t a ranking related issue. For the larger sites it could be, by the way. In this post, I&#8217;d like to explain a bit more about multilingual websites and how hreflang is important for these sites.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatismultilingual\">What is multilingual</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start at the beginning. What is multilingual? In our online context it basically means that content is available in more than one language.</p>\n<p>This can be cross border, for instance French or Chinese, but there is a bit more to that. It can also mean a language variation (so to speak) is available, like our next door neighbors the Belgians have. In Belgium, some speak Flemmish (which is <em>like</em> Dutch) and some speak Walloon (which is <em>like</em> French). More on this later, as we discuss hreflang types. Of course multilingual can also mean people speaking Spanish in an English speaking country. Yes, you can target those as well. It&#8217;s all multilingual.</p>\n<h2 id=\"internationalrankings\">International rankings</h2>\n<p>In an ideal world, you would have a separate website with it&#8217;s own TLD (Top Level Domain) for each language you want to target, like amazon.de and amazon.co.uk. Ideally, these websites would be hosted on a server in the country you want to target. And all should be linked using the <code>hreflang</code> tag from the start. It&#8217;s similar to ranking locally: if you are in the location your target audience is in, you&#8217;re probably relevant to that audience to Google as well.</p>\n<p>All this might be the preferred way to do things, but it has its limitations. What to do when the TLD is already taken, for instance. It also requires you to purchase more domain names, of course. It&#8217;s the best way, but also the way that requires most effort. A lot of international websites have grouped their online activities in one location, one country, and manage all the different languages from there. In that case, you can still use hreflang to your benefit, as hreflang can target both language and country for you.</p>\n<p>Lastly, you should also tell Google your preferred geo-audience in Google Webmaster Tools. You can find that at <a href=\"https://yoast.com/google-webmaster-tools-search-traffic/\">Search Traffic &gt; International Targeting &gt; Country &gt; Geographical Target</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hreflangisyourfriend\">Hreflang is your friend</h2>\n<p>If your website serves pages in multiple languages, or your website itself is served in more than one language, you should make hreflang your friend. There is a number of ways that hreflang can help Google understand these variations.</p>\n<p>Google mentions the use of <code>rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"x\"</code> at least in <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/189077?hl=en\">these three cases</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Translate only the template parts, like the navigation and footer, while using one language, f.i. English, for the content. This could be the case for website that consist mainly of user-generated content like a forum.</li>\n<li>There are small regional variations, but most of the text is the same, like variations of English used in the United States, Great Britain and Ireland.</li>\n<li>The entire site is translated into other languages than the original.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to add one. You can also add <code>hreflang=\"x\"</code>, where x is the language, to a link. In that case, the hreflang attribute should reflect the language of the page in the link. That way, you are telling Google that there will be a different language at the other side of that link. This is especially useful for sites that actually tell the visitor the site or page is available in other languages as well by linking these pages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"locationsofhreflang\">Locations of hreflang</h2>\n<p>Besides in the link mentioned in the section above, there are a couple of ways to tell Google about the language variations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Place an HTML link in the header. You could add a language alternative to your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> like this:\n<pre style=\"margin-top: 0;\">&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"nl\" href=\"http://nl.example.com/\" /&gt;</pre>\n</li>\n<li>In your HTTP header, for instance via your <code>.htaccess</code> file. This is mainly for non-HTML files like PDF&#8217;s and might look something like this:\n<pre style=\"margin-top: 0;\">Link: &lt;http://nl.example.com/&gt;; rel=\"alternate\"; hreflang=\"nl\"</pre>\n</li>\n<li>XML sitemap. You can also add language alternatives via your sitemap. This is a bit more technical; read more about it in <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2620865?hl=en\">Webmaster Tools</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"examplesoflanguageindicators\">Examples of language indicators</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s go over a number of variations to make this all just a bit more clear. For starters, you want to make sure all languages are covered, even the ones you are not targeting. You can easily add a &#8216;default&#8217; page by setting an <a href=\"http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.nl/2013/04/x-default-hreflang-for-international-pages.html\"><code>x-default</code></a> hreflang element:</p>\n<pre style=\"margin-top: 0;\">&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://example.com/\" hreflang=\"x-default\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p>This simply indicates that if none of the alternate links is matched, this page should be served.</p>\n<p>That x-default can be replaced by a language and a country like this:</p>\n<pre style=\"margin-top: 0;\">&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://example.com/en-gb\" hreflang=\"en-gb\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p>That is a hreflang setting for all English speakers in Great Britain / United Kingdom (UK). This also points out the importance of the <code>x-default</code>, as this line only targets the visitors that come from the UK (server side) and prefer the English language (client side).</p>\n<p>As mentioned, alternative could be:</p>\n<pre style=\"margin-top: 0;\">&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://example.com/en-us\" hreflang=\"en-us\" /&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://example.com/en-au\" hreflang=\"en-au\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p>By the way, I have seen <code>en-us</code> and <code>en-US</code>, for China it could even be <code>zh-Hans</code>. I don&#8217;t think there is a right and wrong in uppercase/lowercase. Even Google uses <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/189077?hl=en\">both in one article</a>. I have also seen brave tries to use <code>en_GB</code>, but that underscore won&#8217;t work; it needs to be a hyphen.</p>\n<h3>One more thing</h3>\n<p>To finish things off, you also want to add a notice of these alternative pages via OpenGraph:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The locale these tags are marked up in. Note that OpenGraph <em>does </em>use an underscore.\n<pre style=\"margin-top: 0;\">&lt;meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_GB\" /&gt;</pre>\n</li>\n<li>An array of other locales this page is available in.\n<pre style=\"margin-top: 0;\">&lt;meta property=\"og:locale:alternate\" content=\"fr_FR\" /&gt;\n&lt;meta property=\"og:locale:alternate\" content=\"es_ES\" /&gt;</pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More on that for instance on the <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/guides/internationalization\">Facebook developers pages</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hreflangandseo\">Hreflang and SEO</h2>\n<p>The big question for us of course is &#8220;what will this all do for SEO?&#8221; Well, that seems to depend on for instance the size of the site and the way the content in the original language is already indexed.</p>\n<p>I have read a number of case studies, and have discussed it with colleagues. If your website ranks well, and has a significant size, adding a new language and <code>hreflang</code> tags might indeed help the rankings of the &#8216;new&#8217; website. Google might even index all as one (if it&#8217;s one domain), which means a lot more pages for the main domain will be indexed. If these are all of quality, that obviously won&#8217;t hurt.</p>\n<p>Having said that, the other way around also seems to be the case. Low rankings for your main site won&#8217;t help the language alternatives. And for smaller sites, the overall impact seems to be very little.</p>\n<p>Should you add <code>hreflang</code>? Yes, you should. Will it help your SEO / rankings? It might.</p>\n<p>Some of the case studies that led to that believe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.seerinteractive.com/blog/case-study-the-impact-of-hreflang-tag/\">Case study: The impact of hreflang tag</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://vagelisvarfis.com/2014/07/hreflang-and-geo-targeting-the-netflix-case-study/\">Hreflang and Geo-Targeting – the Netflix Case Study</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.themediaflow.com/blog/an-international-seo-implementation-tale-sitemaps-relalternate-hreflangx\">An international SEO implementation tale &#8211; sitemaps: rel=&#8221;alternate&#8221; hreflang=&#8221;x&#8221;</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Your call</h2>\n<p>I hope this post brought you some more understanding of the <code>hreflang</code> tag. If you have a multilingual site, it will help Google understand your site. And that alone should be a reason to add it.</p>\n<p>Next to that, I&#8217;m very much looking forward to reading your thoughts on this subject and even more to your own case study or studies. Feel free to link your hreflang case study in the comments!</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-333157 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/thank-you-550x365.jpg\" alt=\"Thanks for reading\" width=\"550\" height=\"365\" /></p>\n<p>This post first appeared as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yoast.com/hreflang/\">Use hreflang for multilingual websites</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yoast.com\">Yoast</a>.

It&#8217;s similar to ranking locally: if you are in the location your target audience is in, you&#8217;re probably relevant to that audience to Google as well.</p>\n<p>All this might be the preferred way to do things, but it has its limitations. What to do when the TLD is already taken, for instance. It also requires you to purchase more domain names, of course. It&#8217;s the best way, but also the way that requires most effort. A lot of international websites have grouped their online activities in one location, one country, and manage all the different languages from there. In that case, you can still use hreflang to your benefit, as hreflang can target both language and country for you.</p>\n<p>Lastly, you should also tell Google your preferred geo-audience in Google Webmaster Tools. You can find that at <a href=\"https://yoast.com/google-webmaster-tools-search-traffic/\">Search Traffic &gt; International Targeting &gt; Country &gt; Geographical Target</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hreflangisyourfriend\">Hreflang is your friend</h2>\n<p>If your website serves pages in multiple languages, or your website itself is served in more than one language, you should make hreflang your friend. There is a number of ways that hreflang can help Google understand these variations.</p>\n<p>Google mentions the use of <code>rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"x\"</code> at least in <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/189077?hl=en\">these three cases</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Translate only the template parts, like the navigation and footer, while using one language, f.i. English, for the content. This could be the case for website that consist mainly of user-generated content like a forum.</li>\n<li>There are small regional variations, but most of the text is the same, like variations of English used in the United States, Great Britain and Ireland.</li>\n<li>The entire site is translated into other languages than the original.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to add one. You can also add <code>hreflang=\"x\"</code>, where x is the language, to a link. In that case, the hreflang attribute should reflect the language of the page in the link. That way, you are telling Google that there will be a different language at the other side of that link. This is especially useful for sites that actually tell the visitor the site or page is available in other languages as well by linking these pages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"locationsofhreflang\">Locations of hreflang</h2>\n<p>Besides in the link mentioned in the section above, there are a couple of ways to tell Google about the language variations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Place an HTML link in the header. You could add a language alternative to your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> like this:\n<pre style=\"margin-top: 0;\">&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"nl\" href=\"http://nl.example.com/\" /&gt;</pre>\n</li>\n<li>In your HTTP header, for instance via your <code>.htaccess</code> file. This is mainly for non-HTML files like PDF&#8217;s and might look something like this:\n<pre style=\"margin-top: 0;\">Link: &lt;http://nl.example.com/&gt;; rel=\"alternate\"; hreflang=\"nl\"</pre>\n</li>\n<li>XML sitemap. You can also add language alternatives via your sitemap. This is a bit more technical; read more about it in <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2620865?hl=en\">Webmaster Tools</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"examplesoflanguageindicators\">Examples of language indicators</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s go over a number of variations to make this all just a bit more clear. For starters, you want to make sure all languages are covered, even the ones you are not targeting. You can easily add a &#8216;default&#8217; page by setting an <a href=\"http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.nl/2013/04/x-default-hreflang-for-international-pages.html\"><code>x-default</code></a> hreflang element:</p>\n<pre style=\"margin-top: 0;\">&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://example.com/\" hreflang=\"x-default\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p>This simply indicates that if none of the alternate links is matched, this page should be served.</p>\n<p>That x-default can be replaced by a language and a country like this:</p>\n<pre style=\"margin-top: 0;\">&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://example.com/en-gb\" hreflang=\"en-gb\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p>That is a hreflang setting for all English speakers in Great Britain / United Kingdom (UK). This also points out the importance of the <code>x-default</code>, as this line only targets the visitors that come from the UK (server side) and prefer the English language (client side).</p>\n<p>As mentioned, alternative could be:</p>\n<pre style=\"margin-top: 0;\">&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://example.com/en-us\" hreflang=\"en-us\" /&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://example.com/en-au\" hreflang=\"en-au\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p>By the way, I have seen <code>en-us</code> and <code>en-US</code>, for China it could even be <code>zh-Hans</code>. I don&#8217;t think there is a right and wrong in uppercase/lowercase. Even Google uses <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/189077?hl=en\">both in one article</a>. I have also seen brave tries to use <code>en_GB</code>, but that underscore won&#8217;t work; it needs to be a hyphen.</p>\n<h3>One more thing</h3>\n<p>To finish things off, you also want to add a notice of these alternative pages via OpenGraph:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The locale these tags are marked up in. Note that OpenGraph <em>does </em>use an underscore.\n<pre style=\"margin-top: 0;\">&lt;meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_GB\" /&gt;</pre>\n</li>\n<li>An array of other locales this page is available in.\n<pre style=\"margin-top: 0;\">&lt;meta property=\"og:locale:alternate\" content=\"fr_FR\" /&gt;\n&lt;meta property=\"og:locale:alternate\" content=\"es_ES\" /&gt;</pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More on that for instance on the <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/guides/internationalization\">Facebook developers pages</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hreflangandseo\">Hreflang and SEO</h2>\n<p>The big question for us of course is &#8220;what will this all do for SEO?&#8221; Well, that seems to depend on for instance the size of the site and the way the content in the original language is already indexed.</p>\n<p>I have read a number of case studies, and have discussed it with colleagues. If your website ranks well, and has a significant size, adding a new language and <code>hreflang</code> tags might indeed help the rankings of the &#8216;new&#8217; website. Google might even index all as one (if it&#8217;s one domain), which means a lot more pages for the main domain will be indexed. If these are all of quality, that obviously won&#8217;t hurt.</p>\n<p>Having said that, the other way around also seems to be the case. Low rankings for your main site won&#8217;t help the language alternatives. And for smaller sites, the overall impact seems to be very little.</p>\n<p>Should you add <code>hreflang</code>? Yes, you should. Will it help your SEO / rankings? It might.</p>\n<p>Some of the case studies that led to that believe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.seerinteractive.com/blog/case-study-the-impact-of-hreflang-tag/\">Case study: The impact of hreflang tag</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://vagelisvarfis.com/2014/07/hreflang-and-geo-targeting-the-netflix-case-study/\">Hreflang and Geo-Targeting – the Netflix Case Study</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.themediaflow.com/blog/an-international-seo-implementation-tale-sitemaps-relalternate-hreflangx\">An international SEO implementation tale &#8211; sitemaps: rel=&#8221;alternate&#8221; hreflang=&#8221;x&#8221;</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Your call</h2>\n<p>I hope this post brought you some more understanding of the <code>hreflang</code> tag. If you have a multilingual site, it will help Google understand your site. And that alone should be a reason to add it.</p>\n<p>Next to that, I&#8217;m very much looking forward to reading your thoughts on this subject and even more to your own case study or studies. Feel free to link your hreflang case study in the comments!</p>\n<p><img class=\"nopadding aligncenter wp-image-333157 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/thank-you-550x365.jpg\" alt=\"Thanks for reading\" width=\"550\" height=\"365\" /></p>\n<p>This post first appeared as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yoast.com/hreflang/\">Use hreflang for multilingual websites</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://yoast.com\">Yoast</a>.

This post will go into how you can leverage email in your ecommerce business to gain new, lost or recurring clients.</p>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n<h2>Every subscriber counts</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s much easier for people to subscribe to your newsletter than it is to actually spend money and buy something at your online shop. So you&#8217;re probably getting a lot more newsletter subscriptions than you are getting sales. This is fine, of course, because you&#8217;re still able to reach out to these people. That&#8217;s why every subscriber counts: they&#8217;re all special and valuable to your business.</p>\n<p>A few days ago I got this email from a Dutch webshop:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_332365\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"nopadding wp-image-332365 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Inbox1.png\" alt=\"Newsletter email marketing for online shop\" width=\"664\" height=\"726\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Email from Dutch webshop fonq.nl stating VIP discounts</p></div>\n<p>They&#8217;re offering special &#8220;Exclusive VIP discounts&#8221; in this email. Basically they&#8217;re offering a discount to everyone, but as a newsletter subscriber you get &#8216;early access&#8217; to those discounts. I&#8217;m not sure how legitimate this actually is, as I think the discount was available to everyone from the start. However, it is a nice idea to give your newsletter subscribers just that little edge.</p>\n<p>You can even think about giving your newsletter subscribers a discount, but our preference is to leave perks such as this for your loyal customers. More on that later in this post.</p>\n<h2>Recovery</h2>\n<p>One great way to use emails in your ecommerce business  is by sending recovery emails. Recovery emails are emails that are sent when someone has <a href=\"https://yoast.com/shopping-cart-abandonment/\">abandoned their cart</a> without finishing the transaction. You could email them reminding them there&#8217;s still something in their cart and they&#8217;re welcome to complete the purchase. Usually there&#8217;s a time limit to this, so do mention this. This will actually also create urgency, which can actually help. Some businesses even choose to give discounts after a cart is abandoned. We personally don&#8217;t like to use discounts this way, as it seems unfair to the rest of our customers. However, it does seem to work, so I&#8217;m just putting it out there!</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_326226\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"nopadding wp-image-326226 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bol_com_recovery_email.png\" alt=\"bol com recovery email - email marketing for online shop\" width=\"520\" height=\"575\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Email from Dutch webshop bol.com telling me I&#8217;ve left something in their shopping cart</p></div>\n<p>It can be as simple as this. They&#8217;ve reminded me I&#8217;ve left something in the shopping cart. And just to make it a bit less pushy, they also tell me: &#8220;Maybe you wanted to save this item for another visit to our site. If that&#8217;s the case, please put it on your wish list and be sure it&#8217;s saved.&#8221; So apart from just telling you to go buy the stuff you&#8217;ve left, they also inform you on a helpful functionality. That makes it a lot less intrusive and you&#8217;re actually more likely to go to their site. And whether you end up buying that exact product; it got you back on their website.</p>\n<h2>Retention</h2>\n<p>Email is a great way to increase your customers&#8217; retention. What this means is that it&#8217;ll increase the amount of customers that purchase repeatedly, instead of just once. So this would help make your clients recurring clients. By emailing your customers on a regular basis, your brand will stay top of mind and they&#8217;ll return more quickly to buy something again. Of course your emails would have to be interesting, enticing and engaging for this to really work:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_326211\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"nopadding wp-image-326211 size-full\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Amazon_retention_email1.png\" alt=\"Amazon retention email - Email marketing for online shop\" width=\"520\" height=\"494\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Email from German Amazon asking to review the product you recently bought</p></div>\n<p>Now as with a lot of things on Amazon, this is a stroke of genius. It gives you a good reason to go back to their site, without sounding salesy at all. You end up on their website and before you know it there&#8217;s another dvd, eBook or iPhone 6 in your cart.</p>\n<h3>Related products</h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s another way to get your customers back to your website and maybe ordering some things. My colleague Michiel got an email confirming his order at Wehkamp.nl. The confirmation email included this:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_332384\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"nopadding wp-image-332384 size-large\" src=\"https://yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Inbox-550x264.png\" alt=\"Related products in email marketing for online shop\" width=\"550\" height=\"264\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Related products in email</p></div>\n<p>He had ordered sweaters from this webshop and wehkamp.nl was smart enough to show related products in the confirmation email. The only thing that I&#8217;m thinking is that showing sweaters when you&#8217;ve just bought 3 sweaters might not be the best product group. T-shirts or maybe some pairs of pants would make more sense. But then again, it could just be me and other people might like 10 new sweaters.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, this is a bit more aggressive than the Amazon example, but cross-selling items in your confirmation emails has been found to <a href=\"http://www.experian.com/assets/marketing-services/reports/transactional-email-report.pdf\">increase your transaction rates by 20%</a>. The aggressiveness also comes down to where you place these related items. Wehkamp showed these related items quite close to the bottom of the email, so that makes it a bit less agressive. However, I can image that this also means less people will be enticed to buy something else. This comes down to what works best for your business and what you feel comfortable with.</p>\n<h2>Reward your loyal customers</h2>\n<p>A few months back I wrote a post about <a title=\"Creating loyal customers\" href=\"https://yoast.com/creating-loyal-customers/\">creating loyal customers</a>. Email is a good tool to give something extra to your loyal customers. You can even make different segments of loyal customers and email these groups accordingly. This can start from people who bought just one product to people who have bought a multitude of items in your online shop.</p>\n<p>By giving these customers something extra, you&#8217;re expressing your gratitude that they&#8217;re you customers. And, of course, in return you&#8217;ll get another nice revenue boost from your most loyal customers.</p>\n<h2>How&#8217;s your email marketing?</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m really curious as to whether I bored you out of your skull or you&#8217;ve actually learned something. Do you think you&#8217;re doing a good job at your email marketing, or did this post just wake you up?

We’ve brought these experiences from your admin and re-created them right here on WordPress.org.</p>\n<h3>Theme Directory</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/\">Theme Directory</a> has a better browsing experience, with handy tabs where you can view featured, popular, and the latest themes. As with the theme experience in your admin, you can use the feature filter to browse for just the right theme for your WordPress website.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-3572\" src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2015/04/theme-directory-1024x768.png\" alt=\"theme-directory\" width=\"692\" height=\"519\" /></p>\n<p>Click on a theme to get more information about it, including shiny screenshots, ratings, and statistics.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-3573\" src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2015/04/theme-directory-individual-1024x768.png\" alt=\"theme-directory-individual\" width=\"692\" height=\"519\" /></p>\n<p>Konstantin Obenland <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/10/new-theme-directory/\">posted a good overview</a> of everything involved with the theme directory overhaul and followed up with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/31/theme-directory-stats/\">a post on improved statistics</a>.</p>\n<h3>Plugin Directory</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\">Plugin Directory</a> has a brand new theme that mirrors the experience in your WordPress admin, with a more visual experience, and better search and statistics.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-3594\" src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2015/04/plugin-directory-1024x768.png\" alt=\"plugin-directory\" width=\"692\" height=\"519\" /></p>\n<p>As well as a facelift, there are some great new features for you to play around with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Favorites – when you’re logged in to you WordPress.org account, this page gives you direct access to the plugins that you have favorited.</li>\n<li>Beta Testing – try out plugins where developers are experimenting with new features for WordPress.</li>\n<li>Search by plugin author – you can search for a plugin author using their username.</li>\n<li>Better statistics – listings now display the number of active installs so you can see how many people are actually using a plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/04/new-plugin-directory-theme/\">overview of the new theme</a> was posted by Scott Reilly.</p>\n<h2>Better Statistics</h2>\n<p>We’ve made huge improvements to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">our statistics</a>. This gives us more useful information about the WordPress versions people are using, their PHP version, and their MySQL version.</p>\n<p>Already these new statistics have provided us with useful insights into WordPress usage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More than 43% of all sites are running the latest version of WordPress. Previously, we thought only 10% of sites were up-to-date. By excluding sites that are no longer online we were able to improve these statistics.</li>\n<li>We were able to clear up the data around WordPress 3.0, bringing it more in line with expectations. This anomaly was a by-product of spammers.</li>\n<li>Only 15.9% of sites are using PHP 5.2, which is better than we thought.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over the coming months we’ll be able to use these statistics to bring you new tools and improvements, and to make more informed decisions across the board.

A <a href=\"http://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/call-for-applications-to-organise-wordcamp-europe-2016-closes-in-5-days/\" target=\"_blank\">final call</a> for host cities went out today and organizers announced that applications will close on Friday, April 24.</p>\n<p>This highly anticipated WordPress event is expected to bring in roughly 1,000 attendees from around the world. Such a massive undertaking requires a revolving planning process that prepares for the next year&#8217;s event while simultaneously planning the current year.</p>\n<p>Organizers for 2016 will be required to attend and assist in organizing the 2015 event as part of the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-now-taking-applications-for-2016-host-city\" target=\"_blank\">new organizer mentoring program</a> the team is piloting this year. Candidates must demonstrate excellent communication skills and become a reliable point of contact before being selected to the learn the ropes for the 2016 event.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We think it&#8217;s important for next year&#8217;s team to get involved in this year&#8217;s organization,&#8221; co-organizer Petya Raykovska said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we started early and one of the requirements for the applying teams is to be available to join the team in Seville if chosen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress representatives in cities vying for the chance to host WCEU 2016 are required to complete a budget for each proposed venue and a detailed application form, which includes a team member summary, transportation and hotel information, and several other aspects of the event.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Compiling the application takes time and it&#8217;s understandable they&#8217;ll all come in the last week,&#8221; Raykovska said. She and other members of the organization team have been in contact with several local WordPress communities that will be applying, as the prospect can be somewhat daunting given the level of detail required.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some teams need a bit of a nudge to feel confident enough to apply, even if they&#8217;ve done exceptional work organizing their local events,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>The host city for WCEU 2016 will be selected by mid-May, which will give the new organizers enough time to get involved in the most active and important stages of the 2015 event. A sample budget and application form are <a href=\"http://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/call-for-applications-to-organise-wordcamp-europe-2016-closes-in-5-days/\" target=\"_blank\">available on the WordCamp Europe website</a>.

In of April 2015, GitHub reported <a href=\"https://github.com/about/press\" target=\"_blank\">9.2 million users collaborating across 21.8 million repositories</a>. For the past seven years since the site&#8217;s launch, one of the most difficult challenges has been getting users to add a license to their projects.</p>\n<p>Recent <a href=\"https://github.com/blog/1964-open-source-license-usage-on-github-com\" target=\"_blank\">open source license usage stats</a> show MIT, GPL, and Apache licenses coming in as the most popular choices with 44.69%, 12.96%, and 11.19% respectively. However, GitHub&#8217;s reckoning shows that licensing numbers are still very low and continue to drop. Only 20% of unforked repositories on the site are currently licensed (30% if you count forked repositories.)</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/percentage-of-github-repositories-licensed.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[42389]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/percentage-of-github-repositories-licensed.png?resize=762%2C445\" alt=\"credit: GitHub.com\" class=\"size-full wp-image-42417\" /></a>credit: <a href=\"https://github.com/blog/1964-open-source-license-usage-on-github-com\">GitHub.com</a>\n<p>Last month GitHub launched its <a href=\"https://developer.github.com/v3/licenses/\" target=\"_blank\">Licenses API</a> in order to combat the continual decline in licensing numbers. &#8220;We want to make it easier for open source developers to license their code, and for open source consumers to verify that they are using open source projects under an appropriate license,&#8221; the announcement said.</p>\n<p>The new Licenses API returns metadata about popular open source licenses and can detect a project&#8217;s license from the repository&#8217;s <code>LICENSE</code> file. Developers are welcome to preview the API while it&#8217;s still under development. Ultimately, GitHub is aiming to use the API to collect and provide more information about the open source licenses in use on the site, as well as the projects that are using them.</p>\n<p>When a project doesn&#8217;t possess a license, it&#8217;s difficult for others to know what their freedoms and limitations are for reproducing, distributing, and modifying the code. Many companies have very strict licensing requirements when it comes to the code they choose to include in their projects.</p>\n<p>In an effort to encourage users to add a license to their projects, GitHub created a handy tool called <a href=\"http://choosealicense.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ChooseALicense.com</a> that helps users select from the more popular open source licenses. The site uses plain language to make it easy to understand what is required, permitted, and forbidden for each license:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/gpl3-license-info-github.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[42389]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/gpl3-license-info-github.png?resize=923%2C161\" alt=\"gpl3-license-info-github\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42450\" /></a></p>\n<p>Repositories with licenses had bottomed out at around 15% on GitHub shortly before it <a href=\"https://github.com/blog/1530-choosing-an-open-source-license\" target=\"_blank\">launched the license picker tool</a>. The sharp increase in licensing in 2013 in the graph above can be attributed to <a href=\"http://choosealicense.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ChooseALicense.com</a>. Unfortunately, over the past two years the number of licensed repositories began to decline again.</p>\n<p>Adding a license to your project is fundamental to sharing your code and empowering others to use it. Open source developers with struggling projects often complain about a lack of contribution. One of the most important things you can do to help your project get a good start is to carefully select an open source license that will be well-suited to the community you&#8217;re trying to build.</p>\n<p>GitHub is aiming to provide more in-depth analysis in the coming weeks using data from the new Licenses API, and also plans to publish how license usage affects project success. If you&#8217;re struggling to select a license for a project that you maintain, check out GitHub&#8217;s <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/open-source-licensing/\" target=\"_blank\">Guide to Open Source Licensing</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 20:33:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: XSS Vulnerability Affects More Than a Dozen Popular WordPress Plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=42387\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"http://wptavern.com/xss-vulnerability-affects-more-than-a-dozen-popular-wordpress-plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8103:\"<p>For the past week, security firm <a title=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/\" href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/\">Sucuri</a> has <a title=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/04/security-advisory-xss-vulnerability-affecting-multiple-wordpress-plugins\" href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/04/security-advisory-xss-vulnerability-affecting-multiple-wordpress-plugins\">worked with the WordPress core security team</a> to address a cross site scripting vulnerability discovered in more than a dozen popular WordPress plugins.

Inaccurate information has existed on both pages for more than five years, leading hundreds, if not thousands, of developers to use insecure code in plugins.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/UpdatingTheCodex.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[42387]\"><img class=\"wp-image-42392 size-full\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/UpdatingTheCodex.png?resize=940%2C607\" alt=\"The Updated Codex Pages\" /></a>The Updated Codex Pages\n<p>The vulnerability was <a title=\"https://yoast.com/coordinated-security-release/\" href=\"https://yoast.com/coordinated-security-release/\">first reported by Joost de Valk</a> who has an excellent post describing the issue.

Gary Pendergast, who is helping to manage the coordinated effort says, he doesn&#8217;t have an official headcount of the number of plugins affected. &#8220;There is no official head count on how many plugins are affected, as it’s a case-by-case thing to check.&#8221; Some of the vulnerable plugins within the list have opted-out of automatic updates. &#8220;Jetpack, EDD, P3, Download Monitor and Related Posts for WP opted-in to auto updates. I didn’t keep track of who opted out,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>So far, there is no evidence that suggests the vulnerability is being actively exploited. It&#8217;s extremely important that plugin authors revisit your code to make sure you&#8217;re not improperly using the <a title=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_query_arg\" href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_query_arg\"><i>add_query_arg()</i></a> and <a title=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/remove_query_arg\" href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/remove_query_arg\"><i>remove_query_arg()</i></a> functions.

The post features <a title=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_query_arg\" href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_query_arg\"><i>add_query_arg()</i></a> and <a title=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/remove_query_arg\" href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/remove_query_arg\"><i>remove_query_arg()</i></a>, but near the end of the post, Jolly reminds developers to escape everything.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This caught me out a few weeks ago when I found out (the hard way) that WordPress doesn’t automatically sanitize the current URL if you don’t pass in your own. You need to use esc_url during output:</p>\n<p>echo esc_url( add_query_arg( $key, $value ) );</p>\n<p>If you forget to do this, a malicious URL, for example one containing some JavaScript, could potentially be output and executed on your page. Escape all the things to be safe!</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Battle Testing the Automatic Updater</h2>\n<p>To date, this is the largest coordinated effort between an outside party, the WordPress core and security teams, and plugin developers. According to Sucuri, affected plugin developers banded together for the common good. Pendergast confirmed that the auto updates only contain code needed to fix the security vulnerability. This should limit the possibility of auto updates breaking sites.</p>\n<p>The plugins listed above have already been patched and updates should be available to all users.

Joost de Valk took the issue to their security partner, Sucuri, and together they understood that the issue could affect far more than plugins than WordPress SEO and Google Analytics by Yoast.</p>\n<p>They worked with WordPress lead developer and WordPress.org plugin team member Dion Hulse to evaluate how many other top plugins may be vulnerable. Combined, Joost <a href=\"https://yoast.com/coordinated-security-release/\">notes in his security notice post</a> that 44 people joined a dedicated WordPress Slack channel to work on the updates, which resulted in the coordinated release.</p>\n<h3>Millions of websites affected</h3>\n<p>Millions of websites are vulnerable due to this issue. Jetpack and Yoast&#8217;s WordPress SEO alone are active on well over a million websites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/04/security-advisory-xss-vulnerability-affecting-multiple-wordpress-plugins\">Sucuri has identified</a> a minimum of fifteen plugins affected, but they note they&#8217;ve only looked into the top &#8220;300-400&#8243; and others that were notable.</p>\n<p>In all likelihood, many more plugins than those listed will have similar vulnerabilities. <code>add_query_arg()</code> and <code>remove_query_arg()</code> are relatively common functions in advanced WordPress development.</p>\n<h3>Not always a high risk vulnerability</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to speak for exactly how high risk the mis-use of the functions could be, as they are used in different ways in different plugins; and even within a certain plugin codebase, they could be used many times and have different risk levels in each instance.</p>\n<p>Escaping is a fundamental development principal. One of my favorite coffee mugs (pictured above) is from WordPress.com VIP and says, &#8220;Sanitize early, escape late, and drink often.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is therefore concerning that there was such broad misuse of a WordPress function for so long, and it went unchecked in the Codex.</p>\n<p>The Codex previously had examples without escaping, and it had no indication whether the return value was escaped or not. It simply stated that the return value as, &#8220;New URL query string.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This has been updated, both in the examples and the return value section, to note that it can potentially return unescaped data.</p>\n<blockquote><p>New URL query string. Note that this string may contain unescaped data not intended for a URL, especially if the data added comes from user input. The result should be passed through esc_url() before being output as HTML, in a link.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That said, of the developers I&#8217;ve spoken to, even with the vulnerabilities in place they say that the risk of exploitation is small, due to the privileges required of users to attack. Though it is important to note that <em>that is no guarantee</em>, and it is important to update your plugins if you have updates available.</p>\n<p>The Codex is a wiki. It&#8217;s not a fundamental issue of WordPress that this was poorly documented, however it does point to some of the problems that have been noted for some time in regard to the value of the Codex. In fact, just this morning the Codex page for <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_query_arg/\">add_query_arg()</a> was redirected to the new developer.wordpress.org page for the function instead.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the Codex will go away for most functions that can point to the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org\">new developer reference</a>.</p>\n<h3>Five plugins opting in to forced updates</h3>\n<p>Jetpack, Easy Digital Downloads, P3 Plugin Profiler, Download Monitor, and Related Posts for WordPress are all opting in to automated forced updates from WordPress.org. This means that these plugins have created new releases for each major branch of their plugins to be distributed and automatically updated by the WordPress.org team.</p>\n<p>Other plugins are not opting in. Notably, Yoast did not opt in for WordPress SEO or their Google Analytics plugin. Joost de Valk cites concerns that some site owners had their plugins deactivated during the <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress-seo-security-release/\">last forced upgrade process</a> they went through.</p>\n<p>Indeed, my own site has had plugins deactivate when forced updated each time it&#8217;s occurred. I took this issue to members of the WordPress.org update team, and was told that they believe it is an edge case occurrence, and that while they are monitoring new updates, there is not currently a plan to change practices for the updates. I will be very interested with the updates today how commonly this happens.</p>\n<h3>Other posts and resources</h3>\n<p>I will continue to collect plugin update posts, changelogs, and other resources for this update. If you run a WordPress website, these updates will likely affect you.</p>\n<p>There is no reason for panic or to be too concerned, but you should update your plugins as soon as you can to reduce your risk of vulnerability.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/04/security-advisory-xss-vulnerability-affecting-multiple-wordpress-plugins\">Sucuri security notice</a></li>\n<li><a

Topics include Building SaaS with WordPress, A/B testing and usability testing, Git Tricks, the WP REST API, and more.</p>\n<p>Tickets are no longer available, since the event completely sold out, but those who cannot attend can still catch the presentations live. The organizers will offer free live streaming of the event starting at <a href=\"http://time.is/compare/0900AM_18_Apr_2015_in_Belgrade\" target=\"_blank\">9AM in Belgrade</a> (1 AM EST).

Studying web design in college, he stumbled upon WordPress.com early in his career. Dall made the natural progression from WordPress.com to the self-hosted version of WordPress. Since then, he&#8217;s worked almost exclusively with WordPress using it as a blog, CMS, portfolio, and e-commerce. He&#8217;s also an avid photographer.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Coming in WordPress 4.2 is something that has been long overdue and something I have encountered as a former photographer working with WordPress. When you import a photo into WordPress that has IPTC data, the caption populates the description field and not the caption field.</p>\n<p>This is mainly due to the fact that the <a title=\"Website of the IPTC and it\'s standards for photo metadata\" href=\"https://iptc.org/standards/photo-metadata/\">IPTC</a> (International Press Telecommunications Council) calls the caption the description. When WordPress integrated all of the camera metadata (also called EXIF meta data) and caption data, they mistakenly populated the caption field into the wrong field.</p>\n<p>In <a title=\"http://ottopress.com/2011/picasa-and-wordpress-and-captions/\" href=\"http://ottopress.com/2011/picasa-and-wordpress-and-captions/\">this blog post</a>, Samuel “Otto” Wood points out the problem and created a plugin to address the issue. While this is a good fix for projects like the new <a title=\"Art Wolfe website\" href=\"http://artwolfe.com/\">Art Wolfe</a> website, I knew WordPress could be easier to use for photographers who use the IPTC data fields. Those who don’t wouldn&#8217;t notice a change.</p>\n<h2>The Benefits of This Small Change</h2>\n<p>I think media organizations that use WordPress and those that might in the future, will benefit from this industry standard being properly integrated into something that powers more than 20% of the internet.</p>\n<p>Photography plugin developers such as <a title=\"WooCommerce Photography Plugin\" href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-photography/\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce Photography,</a> could really benefit from this small change to core as similar plugins inherently use the built-in media uploader in WordPress. The problem is that it requires unit tests to be written and some changes to WordPress core, stuff that is well beyond my WordPress knowledge.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://artwolfe.com/\">Art Wolfe</a> project has allowed me to work with a great WordPress developer named <a title=\"Sergey Biryukov\" href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/SergeyBiryukov\" target=\"_blank\">Sergey Biryukov</a>. I knew if I gathered enough interest in a patch, I could approach Biryukov with the idea that we might get this fix into WordPress and put a <a title=\"Use Exif description to autofill the caption\" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7580\">seven-year-old trac ticket</a> to bed.</p>\n<h2>What I Did to Get This Issue Fixed</h2>\n<p>I didn’t write a lick of code, write the ticket, and no props are coming my way, nor should they. It was <a title=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/31694\" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/31694\">Biryukov</a> who wrote the final patch and got it committed with props to <a title=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/beaulebens\" href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/beaulebens\">@beaulebens</a>, <a title=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ericlewis\" href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ericlewis\">@ericlewis</a>, and <a title=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/bendoh\" href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/bendoh\">@bendoh</a>.</p>\n<p>I attended every core meeting until it was committed. Whenever there was an “open discussion” time during the meeting, I mentioned the ticket. I also let Drew Jaynes, 4.2 release lead and former photographer, know of my intentions. I tested the patch on a number of <a title=\"WordPress gallery plugins \" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22768#comment:20\">heavily used photography plugins</a> to see if there would be any adverse impact on them. Subsequently, I haven’t found any that were directly attributed to the patch.</p>\n<p>Since I am mainly self-employed, I had the ability to lobby this ticket during what would be considered working hours and, like <a title=\"Rick Ashley Never gonna give you up gif\" href=\"http://robertdall.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Never-gonna-give-you-up.gif\" rel=\"prettyphoto[42322]\">Rick Astley, “I was never going to give you up.” </a>So photographers rejoice! Caption information will be automatically imported into WordPress and your work flow of importing, editing, and captioning using the <a title=\"https://iptc.org/standards/photo-metadata/\" href=\"https://iptc.org/standards/photo-metadata/\">IPTC standard</a> will be completely integrated into WordPress.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 23:30:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"Post Status: The Excerpt Episode 4 — WordPress news with Daniel Espinoza\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=12337\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://poststatus.com/the-excerpt-episode-4-wordpress-news-with-daniel-espinoza/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2013:\"<p>Welcome to <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft/the-excerpt/\">The Excerpt</a> Episode 4, part of the <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft/\">Post Status Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>. With The Excerpt, we cover a few of our favorite stories from the <a title=\"Post Status Membership Club\" href=\"https://poststatus.com/club/\">Post Status Club</a> over the last week or two.

For the past several months, core developer <a href=\"http://imathi.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Mathieu Viet</a> (@imath) has been spearheading the effort to get the new Attachments API ready for 2.3 with the help of contributions and feedback from the core team.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5429\" target=\"_blank\">Attachments API</a> is a new library that will allow developers to create components that have the ability to manage uploads. The first example of this API in action is a vastly improved core interface for uploading, cropping, and setting profile photos for users and groups. This new <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6290\" target=\"_blank\">extensible avatar UI</a> landed in BP trunk yesterday.</p>\n<p>As you can see below, the new interface allows for the traditional image upload. It also adds the ability for users to access their device camera to capture a profile photo, if they are using a browser that supports <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=stream\" target=\"_blank\">getUserMedia</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/user-camera-capture.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[42306]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/user-camera-capture.png?resize=776%2C890\" alt=\"user-camera-capture\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42330\" /></a></p>\n<p>Administrators can also easily edit a member&#8217;s profile photo from the extended profile screen in the admin.</p>\n<p>For those who prefer the legacy interface, you can use a filter to disable the new UI. This allows you to still keep your BuddyPress core updated, even if you don&#8217;t want to add the new avatar interface to your community. Check out @imath&#8217;s <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2015/04/17/a-good-way-to-shape-the-future-of-buddypress-attachments-is-to-take-care-of-avatars/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on the BuddyPress development blog for details on using the filter, as well as more information on the applicable templates and theme compatibility.</p>\n<p>One of the most exciting things about the new avatar UI is that plugin developers can easily extend it for their own unique purposes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Regarding extensibility: In the long run, we want plugins to be able to add their own versions of the uploader, ideally with a minimal amount of work,&#8221; BP lead developer <a href=\"http://boone.gorg.es/\" target=\"_blank\">Boone Gorges</a> said in discussion on the <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6290\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a>. &#8220;@imath has already demonstrated that it&#8217;s not too difficult, and in the future I imagine that we&#8217;ll discover ways to make it even easier.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gorges emphasized that the focus at the moment is to build a solid replacement for the avatar upload system in 2.3 and then work on continually improving the API over time.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/2.3\" target=\"_blank\">roadmap</a> to view other specific tickets that are in progress for the 2.3 release, which should be available in six weeks at the end of May.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 19:33:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"WPTavern: VersionPress 1.0 Sees the Light of Day\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=42209\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"http://wptavern.com/versionpress-1-0-sees-the-light-of-day\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4267:\"<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/VersionPressFeaturedImage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[42209]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-24643\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/VersionPressFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C200\" alt=\"Version Control Featured Image\" /></a>Version Control Featured Image\n<p>In mid 2014, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/borekb\">Borek Bernard</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JanVoracek\">Jan Voráček</a> from the Czech Republic, <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/versionpress-hopes-to-bring-version-control-to-the-masses\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/versionpress-hopes-to-bring-version-control-to-the-masses\">launched a crowdfunding campaign</a> to fund the development of <a title=\"http://versionpress.net/\" href=\"http://versionpress.net/\">VersionPress</a>. VersionPress is a <strong>version control plugin</strong> for WordPress. It keeps the whole site in a Git repository enabling things like <strong>site-wide reverts, safe updates, </strong>and<strong> easy staging</strong>. Despite not reaching their funding goal, the team pressed on and <a title=\"http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/04/versionpress-1-0-released/\" href=\"http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/04/versionpress-1-0-released/\">has released the first stable version</a> to early backers of the project.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been excited to try VersionPress ever since I learned about it last year. After downloading 1.0, I uploaded it to my test site hosted on BlueHost which is optimized for WordPress. When activated, it will go through a checklist to make sure the server meets the minimum requirements. The minimum requirements are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP 5.3</li>\n<li>Execute external commands</li>\n<li>Git 1.9+ installed</li>\n<li>Write access on the filesystem</li>\n<li>db.php hook</li>\n<li>Not multisite</li>\n<li>Standard directory layout</li>\n<li>.gitignore</li>\n<li>.htaccess or web.config support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;m unable to use VersionPress on my hosting account because it doesn&#8217;t have Git 1.9+ installed. I contacted BlueHost to see if it can be installed on the server and it can&#8217;t. If I want to use Git, I&#8217;d have to upgrade to a VPS or Dedicated hosting plan.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/VersionPressNeedsGit2.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[42209]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-42309\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/VersionPressNeedsGit2.png?resize=1025%2C512\" alt=\"VersionPress Needs Git\" /></a>VersionPress Needs Git\n<p>If Git 1.9+ is not installed on a majority of shared webhosting servers, that&#8217;s a huge audience unable to use VersionPress. To be fair, functionally similar plugins such as <a title=\"https://revisr.io/\" href=\"https://revisr.io/\">Revisr</a> and <a title=\"http://www.presslabs.com/gitium/\" href=\"http://www.presslabs.com/gitium/\">Gitium</a> also require Git to be installed on the server. I asked Bernard why Git is needed to use the plugin, &#8220;To use Git was an important decision that enables all the nice things VersionPress provides but it also means that Git is required on the server, currently. In the future, we plan to relax this requirement but for version 1.0, Git is required,&#8221; Bernard said.</p>\n<p>VersionPress is only available through the <a title=\"http://versionpress.net/#get\" href=\"http://versionpress.net/#get\">Early Access Program</a> which is a cross between early access, crowd-funding, and a standard support plan. The team plans on releasing a new version approximately every three months.</p>\n<p>To say that I&#8217;m disappointed is an understatement. My excitement for VersionPress to be the undo button for WordPress is tempered due to not being able to use it on a live site. I could run Git on my local server, but I want to see how it works in a live environment. Although managed WordPress hosting has become a popular option, the majority of sites on the web use shared hosting. Hopefully, the team can come up with a way to use its plugin without Git being required on the same server where VersionPress is installed.</p>\n<p>If you know of a shared webhosting company that runs Git 1.9+ on its servers, tell us about them in the comments.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 18:14:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"Matt: Jiro Ono and René Redzepi\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44961\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"http://ma.tt/2015/04/jiro-ono-and-rene-redzepi/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:219:\"<p>An interesting and thoughtful conversation over a cup of tea between two food masters of our time, Jiro Ono and René Redzepi, <a href=\"http://www.madfeed.co/\">from the MAD site</a>.

Array, formerly known as Okay Themes, <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/okay-themes-pulls-out-of-themeforest-rebrands-as-array\" target=\"_blank\">pulled out of Envato&#8217;s marketplace last April</a> to rebrand and relaunch with the freedom to further build the business.</p>\n<p>At that time, McAlister said, “After fighting the good fight for five years, my body of work has officially outgrown the ThemeForest marketplace. Although it has been a great platform for starting my business, my own ethos and aspirations have evolved.”</p>\n<p>In a surprise about-face, Array is returning to Themeforest with a selection of themes and selling as a non-exclusive author. McAlister considers this an expansion of their independent shop, which has experimented with a number of different distribution channels.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The thing is, Themeforest dominates when it comes to market share,&#8221; he said in a recent <a href=\"https://array.is/a-year-in-review/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> explaining the change. &#8220;<span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">With all of the various avenues we tried, none came close to the reach or revenue that Themeforest has provided in years past.</span>&#8221;</p>\n<p>McAlister <a href=\"https://wpchat.com/t/array-is-moving-back-onto-themeforest/789/3?u=pollyplummer\" target=\"_blank\">replied</a> to a thread on WP Chat to clarify that the decision was not motivated by a lack of sales or desire to cut back on Array. Rather, they see Themeforest as an opportunity to increase exposure to the brand, despite the fact that Array will now make just $19 per theme sale on the marketplace while still attempting to provide quality support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ve definitely been selling more themes at the $49 price point in the short term, but we’re still quantifying that data to see if it’s where we want to be ultimately,&#8221; McAlister said.</p>\n<h3>Drawbacks of Selling with WordPress.com and Creative Market</h3>\n<p>Even more interesting than Array&#8217;s move back to Themeforest are the insights McAlister shared about selling via other marketplaces. After exploring multiple avenues of distribution during the past year, he found the most significant drawbacks came with <a href=\"https://creativemarket.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Market</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.com</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The first few months of our time on Creative Market, we&#8217;ve only seen ~20 sales per month,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Although there is a ton of activity for other kinds of digital goods, the WordPress category simply doesn&#8217;t seem to be thriving.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Array&#8217;s experience with WordPress.com was similarly disappointing, due to the company&#8217;s recent promotion of free themes in the past several months and lengthy wait times in the approval queue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The review process on WordPress.com is long,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;I’m not talking about weeks long, I’m talking about months long. Each Array theme review has taken at least a month, usually longer. Our latest theme for WP.com, Camera, took four months from the day I submitted it to the day it was released.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While his experience may not represent that of all theme authors on WordPress.com, the structure of the selling process makes it difficult for authors to build a reliable source of income.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At any rate, as you can imagine, releasing products this far apart makes it difficult to gain momentum, predict sales figures, and establish a reliable stream of income,&#8221; he said. &#8220;On top of that, because theme sales aren&#8217;t calculated until after the refund window has passed (understandably), it can be several months until you see return on a theme.&#8221;</p>\n<p>McAlister&#8217;s disappointing experiences with Creative Market and WordPress.com contributed to his decision to move back to Themeforest. Although Array is currently bringing in double the monthly revenue it was making on Themeforest previously, the shop still relies on outside distribution channels.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It would be super great if Array was suddenly wildly successful and we could just sell themes solely through the site and not rely on marketplaces, but that’s not the reality of the commercial theme world right now,&#8221; McAlister <a href=\"https://array.is/a-year-in-review/#comment-10012\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in response to comments on his announcement.</p>\n<p>No marketplace is perfect and each has its own unique drawbacks, but Array&#8217;s experiences this past year re-established Themeforest as the clear winner for the shop&#8217;s current needs.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Furthermore, as <a href=\"http://philiparthurmoore.com/2015/02/26/themeforest/\" target=\"_blank\">poignantly stated</a> by Philip Moore recently, there exists no better or more accessible platform for developers to distribute commercial WordPress themes right now. WordPress.com isn&#8217;t accepting new partners, Creative Market doesn&#8217;t have a sustainable market for themes, and starting a new theme shop without an established following would be nothing more than an exercise in futility.</p></blockquote>\n<p>McAlister hopes that Array can have a positive impact on the Themeforest marketplace, instead of remaining among those that criticize from the sidelines.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Given that we spend a great deal of time crafting themes to high standards, in both form and function, we want to help further promote the idea of design-driven, feature-conscious themes, without sacrificing quality or selling your soul to the devil,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to show people that you can, in fact, make a living creating honest products.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 22:12:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: Cloudup Refreshes Its Web Interface and OSX 10.10 Desktop App\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=42232\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"http://wptavern.com/cloudup-refreshes-its-web-interface-and-osx-10-10-desktop-app\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2358:\"<p><a title=\"https://cloudup.com\" href=\"https://cloudup.com\">Cloudup</a>, the file storage and sharing service <a title=\"https://cloudup.com/blog/cloudup-automattic\" href=\"https://cloudup.com/blog/cloudup-automattic\">acquired by Automattic</a> in 2013, has <a title=\"https://cloudup.com/blog/the-new-look-crisp-clean-fresh\" href=\"https://cloudup.com/blog/the-new-look-crisp-clean-fresh\">refreshed its web interface</a>.

The <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/I-am-powering-a-banks-website-using-WordPress-What-security-measures-should-I-take\" target=\"_blank\">question</a> has been viewed more than 30,000 times:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I am powering a bank&#8217;s website using WordPress. What security measures should I take?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ordinarily, such a question is a magnet for trollish responses and uninformed WordPress bashing. However, this time Quora users were delighted to find that Matt Mullenweg, co-creator of WordPress, dropped by to offer an <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/I-am-powering-a-banks-website-using-WordPress-What-security-measures-should-I-take/answer/Matt-Mullenweg\" target=\"_blank\">answer</a> to the question.</p>\n<p>Following a barrage of anti-WordPress remarks from other users, Mullenweg chimed in to clarify how WordPress can be used successfully in the banking industry.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I agree there&#8217;s probably not a ton of benefit to having the online banking / billpay / etc portion of a bank&#8217;s website on WordPress, however there is no reason you couldn&#8217;t run the front-end and marketing side of the site on WordPress, and in fact you&#8217;d be leveraging WordPress&#8217; strength as a content management platform that is flexible, customizable, and easy to update and maintain.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He follows it up with two simple tips for keeping WordPress secure, including making sure the software is updated diligently, and using strong passwords for all user accounts. Mullenweg also solicited examples of WordPress-powered bank websites on his <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2015/04/a-bank-website-on-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> highlighting his Quora response, and several commenters provided links to their work.</p>\n<p>WordPress is often singled out for security concerns, given its high profile and dominant CMS marketshare. The platform is also regularly the target of hackers looking to maximize the return on their efforts. According to Mullenweg, WordPress&#8217; security boils down to how you deploy it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As the most widely used CMS in the world, many people use and deploy the open source version of WordPress in a sub-optimal and insecure way, but the same could be said of Linux, Apache, MySQL, Node, Rails, Java, or any widely-used software.

Williamson describes the last three years as containing some of the highest and lowest points of his life.</p>\n<p>Williamson acknowledged that without his dedicated team, the product wouldn&#8217;t be anywhere close to what it is today. For example, when EDD was first released, it contained 8,085 lines of PHP. Today, EDD has 64,195 lines of PHP, which is nearly an 800% increase.</p>\n<p>He describes what it was like to discover the first severe security vulnerability in EDD that didn&#8217;t require special knowledge to exploit:</p>\n<blockquote><p>On Valentine’s day, 2013, I was notified of a critical security flaw in Easy Digital Downloads that made it possible for someone to gain full admin access to EDD sites that were running a specific configuration of settings in the plugin. Exploiting the flaw was trivial and required no special knowledge of typical exploit methods. With the click of a button, any unauthenticated visitor could become a full admin.</p>\n<p>Realizing that flaw was out in the wild was <strong>terrifying</strong>, and I hated myself for allowing it to happen. Suddenly I was faced with the very real possibility of being the person responsible for the compromise of a large number of sites. To say that I slept poorly that night would be a vast understatement.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Besides the stats, growth, and personal experiences, the thing I find most impressive is the last part of the article where Williamson discusses the impact EDD has had on the lives of those who work on it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Of all reasons to be happy about earning more, the one I like the most is the excellent set of opportunities that open up. I’m not talking about expensive cars, luxury vacations, fancy houses or anything of that nature. No, I’m referring to the opportunities to change peoples lives.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He shares the personal stories of Dan Griffiths, Chris Christoff, Sean Davis and others who are able to make a comfortable living thanks to the success of EDD.</p>\n<p>Griffiths was homeless for five years before he started contributing to EDD. After creating a few successful extensions for the <a title=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/blog/author/ghost1227/\" href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/blog/author/ghost1227/\">marketplace</a>, he found himself in a welcoming community that valued his ideas and contributions. Through his involvement with EDD, he was able to move off the streets, become an active contributor to the project, and regularly attend WordCamps.</p>\n<p>I asked Williamson how long it took to come up with the words to describe the impact his product is having on people&#8217;s lives, <a title=\"https://twitter.com/pippinsplugins/status/588438395279515650\" href=\"https://twitter.com/pippinsplugins/status/588438395279515650\">he responded</a>, &#8220;It took all day.&#8221; If I were in his position, I too would likely have a difficult time putting the impact into words.</p>\n<p>All too often, I think we focus so much on the product that we forget about the impact it has on people&#8217;s lives. For Williamson and his team at EDD, the impact is well documented and celebrated.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 23:04:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"Matt: A Bank Website on WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44952\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"http://ma.tt/2015/04/a-bank-website-on-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3110:\"<p>There&#8217;s a thread on Quora asking &#8220;I am powering a bank&#8217;s website using WordPress. What security measures should I take?&#8221; The answers have mostly been ignorant junk along the lines of &#8220;Oh NOES WP is INSECURE! let me take my money out of that bank&#8221;, <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/I-am-powering-a-banks-website-using-WordPress-What-security-measures-should-I-take/answer/Matt-Mullenweg\">so I wrote one myself</a>, which I&#8217;ve copied below.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I agree there&#8217;s probably not a ton of benefit to having the online banking / billpay / etc portion of a bank&#8217;s website on WordPress, however there is no reason you couldn&#8217;t run the front-end and marketing side of the site on WordPress, and in fact you&#8217;d be leveraging WordPress&#8217; strength as a content management platform that is flexible, customizable, and easy to update and maintain.</p>\n<p>In terms of security, there are a two simple points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure you&#8217;re on the latest version of core and all the plugins you run, and update as soon as new version become available.</li>\n<li>Use strong passwords for all user accounts. For extra credit you could enable a 2-factor plugin, use <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/\">Jetpack&#8217;s WordPress.com login system</a>, or restrict logged-in users to a certain IP range (like behind a VPN).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If your host doesn&#8217;t handle it, make sure you stay up-to-date for everything in your stack as well from the OS on up. Most modern WP hosts handle this (and updates) for you, and of course you could always run your site on <a id=\"qlink_8whpnsgvws\" class=\"qlink qtext_editor_link_text\" href=\"http://vip.wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com VIP</a> alongside some of the top sites in the world. If you use any non-core third party code, no harm in having a security firm audit the source as well (an advantage of using open source).</p>\n<p>For an example of a beautiful, responsive banking website built on WordPress, check out <a href=\"http://gcbaz.com/\">Gateway Bank of Mesa AZ</a>. WordPress is also trusted to run sites for some of the largest and most security-conscious organizations in the world, including Facebook, SAP, Glenn Greenwald&#8217;s The Intercept, eBay, McAfee, Sophos, GNOME, Mozilla, MIT, Reuters, CNN, Google Ventures, NASA, and literally hundreds more.</p>\n<p>As the most widely used CMS in the world, many people use and deploy the open source version of WordPress in a sub-optimal and insecure way, but the same could be said of Linux, Apache, MySQL, Node, Rails, Java, or any widely-used software. It is possible and actually not that hard to run WordPress in a way that is secure enough for a bank, government site, media site, or anything.</p>\n<p>If you wanted any help on this feel free to reach out to Automattic as well, we have a decade of experience now dealing with high-risk, high-scale deployments, and also addressing the sort of uninformed FUD you see in this thread.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve developed a major bank site in WordPress leave a link in the comments.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 19:19:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce Dominates Global E-Commerce Platforms, Passes 7 Million Downloads\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=42000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"http://wptavern.com/woocommerce-dominates-global-e-commerce-platforms-passes-7-million-downloads\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4306:\"<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/woo-commerce.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[42000]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/woo-commerce.png?resize=662%2C300\" alt=\"woo-commerce\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42166\" /></a></p>\n<p>Last week WooCommerce announced that the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/\" target=\"_blank\">plugin</a> had <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/2015/04/woocommerce-7-million-downloads/\" target=\"_blank\">passed 7 million downloads</a> and the WordPress.org plugin directory reports that it is currently in use on over a million websites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce</a> is not only head of the pack when it comes to WordPress e-commerce solutions, the plugin is also the global leader among e-commerce platforms.

However, when <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/reports/woothemes-forks-jigoshop-into-woocommerce/#.VS6gJ_nF_gg\" target=\"_blank\">WooThemes first forked Jigoshop</a> to create the plugin, they had no idea that it would become the staple of their business.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We saw potential, but didn’t envision such a drastic change of direction for our overall business,&#8221; WooThemes co-founder <a href=\"http://jepson.no/\" target=\"_blank\">Magnus Jepson</a> told the Tavern. &#8220;When we initially had the idea for eCommerce for WordPress, our goal was to increase our revenue by selling more eCommerce themes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;James and Mike, our two core WooCommerce developers, came up with the extension model for WooCommerce, which was the key success to turning WooCommerce into the revenue machine that it has become today, making up around 85% of our overall sales.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Downloads of the core plugin are on the rise from 1 million in 2013, to 4 million in August 2014, and 7 million so far this year. WooCommerce currently has 339 free and commercial extensions listed in its official directory, which is the main revenue source driving support and continual development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can’t disclose our exact income unfortunately, but we do process several million dollars per year,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our revenue has been climbing steadily over the past few years, and we are regularly breaking monthly revenue records.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Thanks to the success of the plugin and the growth of its global community, WooThemes hosted the first <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wooconf-the-first-ever-conference-dedicated-to-woocommerce-deemed-a-success\" target=\"_blank\">WooConf</a> in San Francisco last year.

The app now supports two-factor authentication without the need for application passwords. In the past, WordPress mobile apps required an extra step wherein you would generate a unique password for the app on each of your mobile devices. This release eliminates that extra requirement.</p>\n<p>One of the most visible new features in 3.9 is the improved experience of adding media from your device to your site&#8217;s media library. Previously, adding media required a couple extra clicks to navigate to the correct screen for capturing a photo/video or selecting from the mobile device&#8217;s gallery.</p>\n<p>The new media screen includes new buttons at the top that allow you to capture a photo or video with your device. It also displays all of your media sources from one location, a major improvement that makes adding media faster and more convenient.</p>\n<p>Also new in 3.9 is a language selector specific to the app, which currently <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android/blob/develop/tools/exported-language-codes.csv\" target=\"_blank\">supports 32 different languages</a> for publishing.</p>\n<p>The release <a href=\"https://apps.wordpress.org/2015/04/14/wordpress-for-android-version-3-9/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> credits 11 different people for their contributions to 3.9. Development for the <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android/milestones/4.0\" target=\"_blank\">4.0 milestone</a> is already underway on GitHub.</p>\n<p>Android users who are eager to update to the latest version may need to wait a few hours. According to contributor <a href=\"https://github.com/tonyr59h\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Rankin</a>, the update was moved to production today and can take awhile to fully propagate. Users can expect the 3.9 update to hit their devices within 24 hours.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 23:33:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"Matt: Why We Love Repetition\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44948\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"http://ma.tt/2015/04/why-we-love-repetition/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1035:\"<blockquote><p>What is music?

Put the most music-apathetic individual in a household where someone is rehearsing for a contemporary music recital and they will leave whistling Ligeti. The simple act of repetition can serve as a quasi-magical agent of musicalisation.

The site was launched two years ago to provide developer education through videos that allow customers to learn from WordPress experts.</p>\n<p>Live events are now 100% free for everyone to attend, and the price of the recorded sessions has been reduced from $30/each to $9.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The changeup has come entirely from my struggles to get multiple speakers to present within the same small window of time,&#8221; Richards said. With a global audience of both presenters and customers, coordinating timezones often posed a roadblock to scheduling. Richards can now tell the presenters to pick a day and time that works for them and he will be there to record it. The changes also allow for a greater variety of topics.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Rather than bundling three similar presentations under a single event, I can now have entirely different topics going on within the same month, or still keep the month focused to a single topic but have the presentations spread out over a couple of weeks,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>In the past, Richards struggled even to get paying customers to attend the live events, as they opted instead to watch the recorded sessions later.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With the live broadcasts, having direct access to all of these presenters is a HUGE opportunity, so it was always disappointing in past sessions when I’d sell dozens of tickets but still only have 20 or so people attend the live event,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Making the events 100% free to watch live serves a bunch of different purposes. First, it makes the event accessible to someone where the cost could be a blocker (blocker in a sense of &#8216;I don’t yet know if this resource is worth the investment,&#8217; not &#8216;I don’t think I can afford this,&#8217; because the sessions were already super cheap).</p>\n<p>&#8220;Second, it encourages people to actually show up and participate, rather than just sitting back and thinking &#8216;I don’t need to make it live because I can just watch it whenever.\'&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Reviving WPSessions Sales with Cheaper Pricing and Free Live Events</h3>\n<p>WPSessions dropped off the map for a short spell from December to March when Richards struggled to get presenters to commit to scheduling. With the new plan in place, he already has the next five presentations locked in and more on the line.</p>\n<p>WPSessions currently has 100 <a href=\"http://wpsessions.com/vip/\" target=\"_blank\">VIP Members</a>, and Richards hopes to grow that number to 400 this year. He&#8217;s not worried about a loss of revenue with the drastically reduced session pricing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My data shows that most (upwards of 90%) of sales on each session happen within the first two months, and then drop off dramatically after that,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If anything, I think this may actually lead to an increase in revenue from the sessions, because it’s incredibly easy for someone to show up for free and see what WPSessions is all about, and because the back catalog is now so much less expensive.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>The Future of WPSessions in the WordPress Education Space</h3>\n<p>Richards is currently working on producing an intensive WordPress Training Curriculum for developers. The first module, <a href=\"http://wpsessions.com/learn-wordpress-website-mastery/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Website Mastery</a>, will be going up next Monday.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The overall goal of this will be to take someone in any field and teach them the necessary skills to become a profitable WordPress developer – either as an independent contractor, or by joining the ranks of an agency,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The long term goal for WP Sessions is to provide the most comprehensive collection of WordPress training materials that exists anywhere. Entrepreneurs are building new products for WordPress every day but very few have ventured into the WP education space to train developers. Richards has found that it&#8217;s not the easiest market to tackle.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Developers are a fickle bunch,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They like to figure things out for themselves and hack around the internet until they find the answer to a specific problem they’re facing. It’s hard to introduce them to a specific training track because what they want to learn and what they need to learn are often two wholly different things. I know, because I am one.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The WordPress ecosystem does not have an official, respected training certification for developers. While various training sites offer instruction, ranging from site management to development, WPSessions is rare in that it pulls in knowledge from presenters in all corners of the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have yet to find a site that offers the curriculum I&#8217;m looking to provide, which is a full-on cradle-to-grave instruction on Development 101 all the way through to Advanced Techniques, while also hitting on design basics, business development, marketing, and all the other skills an independent contractor needs to have in their wheel house,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>WPSessions isn&#8217;t currently a full-time endeavor, but Richards is working on getting it there this year.

At the beginning of 2015, Matt Mullenweg highlighted Jetpack as one of the most important tools in <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/how-important-is-jetpack-on-wordpress-road-to-50-market-share\" target=\"_blank\">helping WordPress remain competitive</a> and preventing the decline of its market share.</p>\n<p>The team surrounding Jetpack is laser focused on adding compelling features that will help self-hosted sites get everything they need in one convenient pit stop. Whether or not you believe the future of WordPress is hinged on Jetpack&#8217;s success, there&#8217;s no doubt that the professionally-supported plugin has helped self-hosted sites to thrive, with much less effort required on the part of site administrators.</p>\n<p>With 36 modules currently available in the plugin and a never-ending support queue, the distributed team behind Jetpack meets up regularly to build teamwork and keep things running smoothly. At WordCamp London 2015, a good number of the newly expanded team met in person for the first time.</p>\n<p>I had the opportunity to sit down with a few Jetpack representatives, including team lead <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daljo628\" target=\"_blank\">George Stephanis</a>, support specialist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carolynsonnek\" target=\"_blank\">Carolyn Sonnek</a>, and pit crew team member <a href=\"http://jes.se.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jesse Friedman</a> to discuss what it takes to keep Jetpack going strong.</p>\n<h3>Managing the Jetpack Support Load</h3>\n<p>Since their last meetup in August, the Jetpack team has experienced quite a few shakeups. Automattic&#8217;s <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-parka-llc-the-creators-of-bruteprotect\" target=\"_blank\">BruteProtect acquisition</a> added five new team members to the pit crew, bringing their numbers to 10. The Jetpack Manage team, which ties into WordPress.com, has 10 members and is led by Beau Lebens. There are also 10 additional team members allocated for supporting Jetpack user happiness.</p>\n<p>Stephanis always tries to include someone from support, as they represent those who are on the front lines with users every day. The happiness engineers are also divided into sub-teams to manage a support queue that often adds up to several hundred tickets per day. Requests pour into an email inbox from the plugin itself, as well as the WordPress.org support forums.</p>\n<p>Jetpack team members are also active on Twitter and Facebook where they triage requests and help to move users to a more traditional support avenue. The happiness engineers are currently working on a quicker turnaround for support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Right now our goal is to get under 12 hours, and then once we hit that goal, we&#8217;re going to go to five hours, and then on to 1 hour someday,&#8221; Sonnek said. If you take a look at the plugin&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/jetpack\" target=\"_blank\">support forums</a>, you&#8217;ll find that nearly all of the issues are resolved or in process, which is a rarity for WordPress.org plugins. It takes 10 team members to keep it that way.</p>\n<p>Automattic is aware of the number of people currently using Jetpack but will not be disclosing that information publicly. &#8220;We use those numbers internally for reference for how we are doing, or to see if there has been some change that has resulted in an uptake of new connections or something along those lines,&#8221; Stephanis said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the end it&#8217;s a number, and a number without context is very easy to take out of context. <span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">Instead of dwelling on the numbers, we&#8217;re much more interested in what adoption looks like.</span>&#8221; He said that the total number is comparable to the million installs reported by WordPress.org but is probably somewhat less if you account for test sites and hosting partnerships where the plugin is automatically installed but not yet active.</p>\n<h3>Jetpack Focus for 2015: Iterating and Polishing of Current Features</h3>\n<p>For the past few years the Jetpack team has managed a unique balancing act of prioritizing support while fixing bugs and tackling new features at the same time. Many recent releases have introduced new modules, but the team is switching gears in 2015 to focus on keeping the ride smooth.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our focus for the next year is largely going to be on iterating and putting the next bit of spit and polish on features that are already in,&#8221; Stephanis said. &#8220;A lot of the things we&#8217;ve launched need a v2; they need a second pass on it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This new focus will be a change as compared to the previous breakneck speed with which the team was cranking out new modules.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are couple of minor things that other teams are working on that will probably get rolled out to WordPress.com and will probably get synced down to Jetpack as well,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But there&#8217;s no large ticket features that we&#8217;re currently focusing to get into Jetpack and get launched.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is very much a year focused on building up the team, building up familiarity with our internal processes and cultures, and addressing some long-standing technical debt that we&#8217;ve been kind of swamped with paying down.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But now with the resources we currently have, it&#8217;s much easier to focus on the core product offering and how to explain that,&#8221; Stephanis said.</p>\n<h3>Pushing for Goals Over Deadlines</h3>\n<p>Stephanis has been leading Jetpack releases for awhile, but recently the team has started rotating release leads in preparation for his upcoming paternity leave. I asked him if he still feels the weight of pushing out code to millions of users at release time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Every time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m just thinking &#8211;  What edge cases have I missed? Have I forgotten to do something? Have I updated the translations? What if we&#8217;re not compatible with some other plugin?  What if there&#8217;s a name space conflict and we white screen some sites?&#8221;</p>\n<p>With a massive user base using a myriad of different themes and plugins, there&#8217;s always the chance for some unforeseen conflict. The support team has to be prepared to handle that.</p>\n<p>However, Stephanis believes the many problems with releases can be prevented by making sure you&#8217;re never in a rush.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re forcing it through to get it out super quick, you&#8217;re not giving your subconscious the time to turn things over in its own time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying intentionally slow down the development process, but <span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">making sure you&#8217;re never overly rushed by deadlines is one of my best ways to ensure that we&#8217;re not having oops moments</span> or shipping something and then two hours later go &#8216;Oh we forgot the&#8230;\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>As part of this approach, the team focuses on goals and testing more than meeting an arbitrary release schedule.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We set goals more than deadlines,&#8221; Stephanis said. &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s nice to have deadlines and goals but if you&#8217;re overly concerned about the deadline, the quality can slip. We make sure we&#8217;re not shipping anything unless we&#8217;re really comfortable with it, we&#8217;re confident, and we&#8217;ve tested it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The team aims to do at least a one-week translation freeze before releases and generally catches a good deal of bugs during the freeze.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a fantastic Jetpack beta group that we pass releases out to and explain everything new that&#8217;s coming,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some of the edge cases they turn up just blow my mind.&#8221; Having that cushion of time to focus on compatibility and cross testing is essential to mitigating Jetpack&#8217;s conflicts with other plugins.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">Very small issues become very big issues when you&#8217;re running at scale with millions of users</span>,&#8221; Stephanis said. &#8220;If something is only hitting one tenth of one percent, guess what, that&#8217;s a couple thousand users now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With an ever growing user base, the cost of a mistake or conflict gets even more expensive in terms of support. This is where the Jetpack team has learned that not rushing really pays off. The goal, in the end, is not about hitting a release date but rather providing a smooth experience with the release.</p>\n<h3>Overcoming Negative Perceptions of Jetpack</h3>\n<p>One of the constant struggles for the Jetpack team is addressing the negative perceptions of the plugin, especially criticism from the development community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are still a lot of folks who don&#8217;t understand what we&#8217;re actually trying to accomplish,&#8221; Stephanis said. &#8220;I occasionally get questions like, &#8216;With as many things as Jetpack is doing, how are individual plugin authors meant to in any way compete against this?&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The answer to that is we do a lot of general things aimed at raising the tide that lifts all the ships, but we don&#8217;t go in any way in depth. For example, I don&#8217;t think the contact form module in Jetpack has in any way hindered the sales of Gravity Forms.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Developers still have the ability to pick one aspect and go incredibly in depth on it &#8211; yes, we have related posts, but if someone wants to do a plugin that just does related posts and really knocks it out of the park, we&#8217;ll be able to get folks started on the idea of it. Then they&#8217;ll get comfortable and will be much more willing to move to a premium version that they find elsewhere.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Stephanis also emphasized Jetpack&#8217;s extensibility. Plugin authors are even at liberty to utilize the WordPress.com infrastructure while extending Jetpack features. Despite having 36 different modules, the goal has never been to add every possible feature.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the things we fight perception-wise is the concept that Jetpack is bloated,&#8221; Stephanis said. &#8220;Which is an easy thing to think when you see what appears to be 30 some different plugins that you can turn on and off.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When they all tie together with the common core, one plugin can be just one line of code or one plugin could be humongous. It&#8217;s very easy to fall into the idea of: &#8216;I turn off a plugin and that&#8217;s going to make my site go faster, right?&#8217; But the fact of the matter is that everything we do in WordPress and life is always going to be a matter of trade offs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you do something else, it&#8217;s going to affect your site in some fashion. Just by the very fact that you&#8217;re adding some level of complexity. It&#8217;s more of a question of if you want this feature what&#8217;s the best trade off you can get for it. Sam ran a <a href=\"https://bruteprotect.com/the-jetpack-bloat-myth/\" target=\"_blank\">couple</a> <a href=\"http://bruteprotect.com/jetpack-bloat-myth-followup-more-data/\" target=\"_blank\">comparisons</a> and published them on the group blog comparing our commenting form and several of our other features to WP plugins. In comparison, we wind up coming out a little bit ahead.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The download size of Jetpack, currently at 8.2MB, is often a concern for many users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The code base gets a lot of misunderstanding,&#8221; Stephanis said. &#8220;The translations are about 2/3 of it and the Custom CSS module includes a megabyte in and of itself, because we include some JavaScript and CSS to make it pretty as you&#8217;re editing it, SASS and Less precompilers, the CSS sanitization library, all of which for the vast majority of page views isn&#8217;t even loaded.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At the moment, three quarters of Jetpack sites are using English, which means that two thirds of the download size is irrelevant to three quarters of Jetpack users. Getting translations on demand is a major goal for the plugin, but the team has to work with WordPress.org to make it happen.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are waiting on support from WordPres.org to let us use a GlotPress instance to manage our translation flow and then it&#8217;s just a quick switch to start serving it up on their end,&#8221; Stephanis said.</p>\n<p>Until that is resolved, the cost of supporting a global user base will continue to be an extra 5MB on the initial download. Apart from some vocal opposition from developers, most Jetpack users do not seem to mind the size of the download or the number of modules. The features it provides in one package are too compelling and convenient for most of the plugin&#8217;s users to notice the download size.</p>\n<p>Jetpack also gives self-hosted sites access to the infrastructure available on WordPress.com for features that might otherwise create a toll on budget hosting providers, such as related posts and the free Photon CDN. However, Stephanis believes that the quality of maintenance and support are the most compelling reasons to use Jetpack.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the biggest gripes most folks have with the WordPress.org plugin repository is that there are so many abandoned plugins,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These are plugins that either have bugs and never get attention or plugins that, if something breaks, you can never get support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By far the biggest advantage and the best reason to use Jetpack is the fact that we have 20 active developers between Beau&#8217;s team and the pit crew itself, and an active crew of about 10 support folks that are daily focused on enriching the experience, fixing any issues that come up. That, by far, to me is the biggest selling point, the biggest advantage over using 30 different plugins where the code quality may be more questionable.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 22:22:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Matt: John Oliver meets Snowden\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44940\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"http://ma.tt/2015/04/john-oliver-meets-snowden/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:221:\"<p>John Oliver is pretty much always fun to watch, but you should especially send this episode to everyone you know, it&#8217;s important for people to see and understand it.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"></span></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 04:30:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Matt: Apple Watch Horror Story\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44945\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"http://ma.tt/2015/04/apple-watch-horror-story/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:735:\"<p>Read through <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/tech/a-horror-story-constructed-entirely-from-actual-115916627734.html\">this amazing horror story constructed of actual sentences (with links) from reviews of the Apple Watch</a>.

After installing and activating the plugin, you&#8217;ll find the sunburst chart under the <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/disk-usage-sunburst/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/disk-usage-sunburst/\">Tools &#8211; Disk Usage</a> menu.</p>\n<p>A sunburst chart is generated in SVG format that displays the amount of disk space used by each directory and file. The chart takes a little while to get used to as it&#8217;s an alternate way of browsing directories and files. Click any of the arches to browse deeper into a directory. Clicking the center circle will take you back a directory.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SunburstDiskUsage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41934]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41980\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SunburstDiskUsage.png?resize=888%2C798\" alt=\"Suburst Disk Usage\" /></a>One thing I noticed during testing, is that there&#8217;s no visual indication when you click on an arch. There&#8217;s also a delay when selecting an arch since it takes time to render the chart. There might be a bigger impact on performance for sites with large file and directory structures.</p>\n<p>In future updates, I&#8217;d like to see a list of shortcuts such as, largest file, largest directory, etc. This would make it quick to view pertinent information and give users an idea on how the chart works. I&#8217;d also like to see improvements to speed and performance. Disk Usage Sunburst serves its purpose and works fine on WordPress 4.2.

As of January 2015, the app&#8217;s user base has grown to more than <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_virtual_communities_with_more_than_100_million_active_users\" target=\"_blank\">700 million active users</a>, making it the third largest social network on the planet.</p>\n<p>Last year very few WordPress sharing plugins prioritized adding WhatsApp, despite its enormous popularity. This has gradually improved in 2015, as more than two dozen social plugins on WordPress.org now include a WhatsApp sharing button.</p>\n<p>A new plugin released today brings WhatsApp sharing capabilities to Jetpack, which surprisingly doesn&#8217;t include this by default. A <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/755\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> was opened on Jetpack&#8217;s GitHub account to request this feature, but Jetpack representatives recommended that the service be added as a separate plugin.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/whatsapp-jetpack-button/\" target=\"_blank\">WhatsApp Sharing Button for Jetpack</a> was created by Brazilian WordPress developer <a href=\"http://valeriosouza.com.br/\" target=\"_blank\">Valerio Souza</a>. It works seamlessly with the sharing module&#8217;s drag-and-drop configuration and uses the same design style as the other buttons.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/whatsapp-sharing.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41939]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/whatsapp-sharing.jpg?resize=973%2C560\" alt=\"whatsapp-sharing\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41942\" /></a></p>\n<p>After testing the plugin I discovered that the WhatsApp sharing button is intuitively hidden on the desktop version. Users will only see it if viewing a post from a mobile device, including smartphones and tablets. If you don&#8217;t see the button on mobile, make sure you meet the plugin&#8217;s minimum requirements: PHP 5.4+, MySQL 5.5+, WordPress 3.8+.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to see Jetpack add more sharing options for messaging apps. These social networks generally provide a more personal avenue for sharing a post, as opposed to publicly broadcasting to Twitter or Facebook.

The initiative aims to make trusted certificates available to anyone at no cost.</p>\n<p>The idea behind Let&#8217;s Encrypt is to transition as many domains as possible from HTTP to HTTPS by providing a virtually painless one-click enrollment process during the server&#8217;s native installation.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"></span></p>\n<p>The Let&#8217;s Encrypt certificate authority is set to launch mid-2015. Last month, Automattic <a href=\"https://twitter.com/letsencrypt/status/578230030876086272\" target=\"_blank\">joined</a> Mozilla, Cisco, EFF and several other organizations as a major sponsor of the initiative. I spoke with <a href=\"https://barry.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Barry Abrahamson</a>, Chief Systems Wrangler at Automattic, to find out if the company has any plans beyond helping to fund the effort.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have any concrete plans past the sponsorship at this point, but we hope to help bring SSL support to as many WordPress sites as we can,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Last year Automattic <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-to-implement-ssl-for-all-subdomains-joins-the-fight-against-mass-surveillance\" target=\"_blank\">implemented SSL for all *.wordpress.com subdomains</a> as part of the <a href=\"https://www.resetthenet.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Reset the Net</a> campaign against mass surveillance. The company&#8217;s Akismet product recently <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/akismet-improves-user-privacy-by-encrypting-api-calls\" target=\"_blank\">transitioned all calls to its API to use SSL</a> in order to better secure commenter data.</p>\n<p>While many larger WordPress sites have made the move to SSL, the average self-hosted WordPress user is likely to have a tricky time setting it up. That&#8217;s why initiatives like &#8220;Let&#8217;s Encrypt&#8221; are so important.</p>\n<p>However, skeptics aren&#8217;t fully convinced that the new certificate authority will make the web any safer from prying government eyes. Privacy advocate Alexander Hanff wrote a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141120073425-26662417-why-i-won-t-be-using-let-s-encrypt-and-recommend-other-not-to-also\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> explaining why he believes that a new super certificate authority will paint a target on those who use it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Certificate Authorities are the weakest link in the digital security chain. They have the power to issue special master keys (for want of better phrase) which allows a third party to pretend to be someone they are not. In essence, this means if compelled by a secret court order, a certificate authority can provide special certificates to any intelligence agency or other law enforcement body, which will allow them to masquerade as someone else (your bank, Facebook, Google &#8211; anyone who uses that certificate authority for their SSL certificates)</p></blockquote>\n<p>He notes that secret court orders are almost always accompanied by a gag order so that the certificate authority cannot reveal that they have issued special certificates to the government. If the government has unfettered access to &#8220;super master keys&#8221; for thousands of domains, expedited by a new free certificate authority aiming to &#8220;encrypt the entire web,&#8221; then certificate based encryption is rendered worthless.</p>\n<p>The Let&#8217;s Encrypt initiative is positioned to have a radical impact on the number of encrypted sites on the web. Bringing encryption to the masses means that more people will be better protected against attacks such as account hijacking and identity theft. However, if you use the new free certificate authority, it&#8217;s important to understand that your communications may not be secure from government surveillance. Free SSL certificates for everyone will come at a price.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 10:10:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Get Email Alerts for Security Vulnerabilities in Your WordPress Plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=41867\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"http://wptavern.com/get-email-alerts-for-security-vulnerabilities-in-your-wordpress-plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5115:\"<p>WordPress users have been subject to a rash of plugin vulnerabilities over the past couple of months.

The plugin was created to empower causes and non-profits with the ability to host their own donation forms, easily manage reporting and customize emails directly within the WordPress admin.</p>\n<p>Give supports the creation of flexible forms, so that you can accept payments of different amounts or allow users to set a custom amount. Developers can also easily add custom form fields.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/give-plugin-screenshot.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41772]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/give-plugin-screenshot.jpg?resize=779%2C469\" alt=\"give-plugin-screenshot\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41841\" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin is built by the folks behind <a href=\"http://wordimpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WordImpress</a>. Co-founder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/learnwithmattc\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Cromwell</a> said that they naturally fell into the donations niche after many frustrating experiences supporting non-profits without donation-specific tools.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Devin and I both worked with non-profits before WordImpress and struggled with donations every time,&#8221; Cromwell said. &#8220;One client we still serve manages donations with a mess of WooCommerce/Donation Extensions/Subscription Extension/QuickCheckout. Small bugs in one make the whole thing break down. Plus, you don&#8217;t get good reporting on total donations, or donations per donor, and you have to tweak the language strings everywhere.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite a plethora of donation plugins on WordPress.org and donation features integrated into some of the major e-commerce options, the Give team saw an opportunity for a more solid, streamlined approach for collecting and managing donations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We felt like this was a space that really needed a robust &#8211; but best practices &#8211; solution, and Woo and EDD and GForms were just not made for this purpose,&#8221; Cromwell said.</p>\n<h3>Adopting the Freemium Model: Free Core Plugin + Commercial Extensions</h3>\n<p>The team behind Give hopes to monetize the plugin by selling <a href=\"https://givewp.com/addons\" target=\"_blank\">add-ons</a>, the same model used successfully by Easy Digital Downloads, WooCommerce, and other products. Creating a free core product with commercial extensions is becoming an increasingly more popular way of making a business out of developing open source software.</p>\n<p>The core plugin currently supports offline payments and the PayPal Standard payment gateway. Commercial add-ons are available for others, including Stripe, WePay, Authorize.net, Paymill, and PayPal Pro. Offline payments can be useful for sites that are taking registration at events or for people who would prefer to mail a check.</p>\n<p>The Give plugin actually borrows a good deal of its code base from Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) and its gateways, which gave the team a bit of a head start. Trimming it down and writing donation-specific code for the core and gateways was the bulk of the effort.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All together, development of the core plugin, current add-ons, and the website has taken Devin and I roughly 6 months,&#8221; Cromwell said. &#8220;Of course that&#8217;s while maintaining our current sales and support of our existing products and initiating a few other new avenues we&#8217;re headed into (specifically themes).&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Give plugin team plans to create themes for non-profits that will work seamlessly with the Give plugin. &#8220;Themes are a great market, but we want to make sure we do it right, so we&#8217;re taking our time there,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Cromwell reports that sales for the add-ons have been slow so far, and WordPress.org shows less than 10 active installations using the plugin. The team is hopeful that the core plugin will gain more users and that in the future they will be able to transition Give development and support into more of a full-time effort.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe it will take off well,&#8221; Cromwell said. &#8220;We think of our business as setting up &#8216;tent poles&#8217;. For WordImpress, QuickCheckout has been our best tent pole. But now we&#8217;re hoping that Give will become the biggest tent pole that helps raise all others. It&#8217;s another piece of our brand that we&#8217;re really proud of.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The team behind Give partnered with <a href=\"http://girldevelopit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Girl Develop It</a> to support women interested in learning how to code.

The 45-question survey ran for just two weeks in February and the site was able to collect results from more than 26,000 participants.</p>\n<p>Obviously, Stack Overflow survey respondents do not represent a perfect cross section of all developers worldwide, and the overview clearly states the results are skewed by selection bias and language bias, among other biases. However, the site does reach a massive audience of developers, with 32 million visits per month, 25 million of which are return visitors.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of respondents were male (92.1%) who describe their profession as &#8220;Full-stack web developer&#8221; (32.4%), the largest section, followed by student (13.6%), back-end web developer (10.1%), and mobile developer (9.1%).</p>\n<p>WordPress was highlighted as one of the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#tech-super\" target=\"_blank\">most dreaded technologies</a> of those surveyed, trailing Visual Basic and Salesforce. The term &#8220;most dreaded&#8221; was used to indicate the &#8220;% of devs who are developing with the language or tech but have not expressed interest in continuing to do so.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/most-dreaded.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41651]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/most-dreaded.png?resize=1025%2C751\" alt=\"most-dreaded\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41749\" /></a></p>\n<p>Given that Stack Overflow generally attracts English-speaking, full-stack developers who enjoy its gamified question and answer format, it&#8217;s not surprising that you would find WordPress listed among the most dreaded technologies.</p>\n<p>There are many things that are done &#8220;the WordPress way,&#8221; which prevent developers from quickly jumping in when they are new to the platform. WordPress&#8217; unwavering commitment to backwards compatibility is also a major turn off for many developers. However, WordPress usage stats, currently at <a href=\"http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all\" target=\"_blank\">23.7&amp; of all websites</a>, continue to climb higher due to the project&#8217;s deep commitment to its users.</p>\n<h3>Useful Bits for Employers and Job Hunters</h3>\n<p>The Stack Overflow survey may be heavily skewed towards a specific range of developers with similar backgrounds, but the results contain quite a bit of useful information for employers looking to hire developers and for individuals in search of a job.</p>\n<p>For example, the results revealed that &#8220;50% of developers say working remote is at least somewhat important.&#8221; The overview advises employers to strongly consider offering the ability to work remotely. <strong>&#8220;Note to companies trying to hire: if your job listing doesn&#8217;t include remote, you could be cutting your possible applicant pool in half.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Stack Overflow is also able to interpret that data in interesting ways based on users&#8217; experience points on the site. They found that those with the most experience points said that being able to work remotely was non-negotiable.</p>\n<p>Based on 16,522 responses, the results indicate that the average developer spends 7+ hours per week coding on the side. &#8220;70% of respondents reported that they spend 2 or more hours per week programming either as a hobby or working on open source software. 20% of respondents spend more than 10 hours programming away from work.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/side-projects.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41651]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/side-projects.jpg?resize=715%2C373\" alt=\"side-projects\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41803\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a developer hunting for a job and you&#8217;re not spending your free time contributing to open source projects or building your own software, your resume and experience may not be as attractive as others who are active on projects outside of work.</p>\n<p>The survey also provides a comprehensive breakdown of compensation by <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#work-complang\" target=\"_blank\">technology</a>, <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#work-compensation-geo\" target=\"_blank\">purchasing power</a>, <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#work-compensation-remote\" target=\"_blank\">remote status</a>, and <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#work-compensation-so\" target=\"_blank\">Stack Overflow reputation</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/compensation.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41651]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/compensation.jpg?resize=713%2C605\" alt=\"compensation\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41806\" /></a></p>\n<p>Compensation by purchasing power indicates that Ukraine is the top place for developers to live and work, followed by South Africa, USA, Australia, and Russia.

The company has placed thousands of open source repositories on <a title=\"https://github.com/Microsoft\" href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft\">its Github account</a>. When asked if Windows could one day be open source, Mark Russinovich, one of Microsoft&#8217;s top engineers says, &#8220;<a title=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/04/microsoft-open-source-windows-definitely-possible/\" href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/04/microsoft-open-source-windows-definitely-possible/\">It’s definitely possible, it’s a new Microsoft.</a>&#8221; Microsoft <a title=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/openness/default1.aspx#opensource\" href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/openness/default1.aspx#opensource\">even has a website</a> that explains its strategy and showcases open source projects its involved with.</p>\n<h2>Microsoft Azure Teams Up with WordPress</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MicrosoftAzureLogo.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41769]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41786\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MicrosoftAzureLogo.png?resize=799%2C150\" alt=\"MicrosoftAzureLogo\" /></a></p>\n<p>I initially noticed the company&#8217;s change in attitude towards open source in 2009 when Microsoft&#8217;s chief technology officer, Ray Ozzie, announced at the Professional Developers Conference <a href=\"http://www.betanews.com/article/Live-from-the-PDC-2009-Day-1-keynote/1258475450\" target=\"_blank\">that WordPress could be run using the Azure platform</a>. <a title=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/\" href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/\">Windows Azure</a> is a cloud platform that enables you to build, deploy, and manage WordPress sites across a global network of Microsoft-managed data centers. In <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com/2009/11/19/wordpress-and-windows-azure/\">a post </a>on the WordPress.com VIP blog, Matt Mullenweg explained why it&#8217;s a good move.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress and Windows Azure probably aren’t the first two things you’d think of together. WordPress has been free and open source software from the very beginning, Windows not so much, but we’ve always supported as many platforms as possible and for at least 4 years now you could run WP on Windows and IIS (Internet Information Services).</p>\n<p>Choice and competition are great for spurring innovation and better for users and I believe open source software is a good thing even if it’s on a proprietary platform. (Just like we have an open source <a href=\"http://iphone.wordpress.org/\">iPhone application</a>, or encourage people to use <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/\">Firefox</a> on Windows.)</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Supporting the WordPress Community</h2>\n<p>Since 2009, Microsoft has sponsored several WordCamps, meetups, and WordPress specific events. I remember attending a WordCamp in 2010 sponsored by Microsoft and joking with attendees that it must be a mistake.</p>\n<p>However, one of Microsoft&#8217;s representatives was in attendance and assured me that the company was changing its position on open source and sponsoring WordCamps was a good way to spread the message.</p>\n<h2>Examples of Microsoft Using WordPress</h2>\n<p><a title=\"http://webdevstudios.com/\" href=\"http://webdevstudios.com/\">WebDevStudios</a>, a company that specializes in web development using WordPress, has migrated several of Microsoft&#8217;s key websites to WordPress.

The Powerbeats 2 are light, have great battery life (they claim 6 hours, that feels about right), stay in place even when running in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Houston#Summer\">the Houston heat</a>, charge fast, and as a bonus they look cool. (Beats has always been great about that.) The sound? They&#8217;re bad, but good at it. There&#8217;s basically no isolation so you can hear traffic and things around you at lower volumes, which is actually a bonus, and if you turn up the volume they get loud enough to drown other stuff out. Buy these for the function, not the sound quality, and you can pick them up from any Best Buy kiosk in the airport or Apple Store if you lose or forget them, so they&#8217;re pretty ubiquitous.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ma.tt/files/2015/04/71mNNnOhCKL._SL1500_-2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-44930\" src=\"https://ma.tt/files/2015/04/71mNNnOhCKL._SL1500_-2-784x740.jpg\" alt=\"71mNNnOhCKL._SL1500_-2\" width=\"360\" height=\"340\" /></a>I heard about the Sennheisers from <a href=\"http://carlhancock.com/\">Carl Hancock</a> who tried them and gave them a high recommendation. I had trouble finding them but there was a pair local to me at <a href=\"http://www.bhphotovideo.com/\">B&amp;H in New York</a> so I got them delivered and I was immediately impressed with them. They&#8217;re better than my <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2014/10/beats-studio-wireless-vs-samsung-level-over/\">previous wireless over-ear recommendation the Samsung Level Over</a> in every way: sound, size, compatibility, aesthetics, usability, noise canceling.</p>\n<p>The sound is the best I&#8217;ve heard from wireless headphones so far. Just the right balance. The noise canceling apparently uses 4 different mics and I&#8217;ve found it more than sufficient on dozens of plane rides, including passing the noisy baby test. My only complaint is they don&#8217;t &#8220;grip&#8221; my ears as much, so some sound leaks in that way. They fold up to be pretty small, and I just toss them in my backpack. <a href=\"https://ma.tt/files/2015/04/81FYeTRjv4L._SL1500_-2.jpg\"><img class=\"  wp-image-44931 alignleft\" src=\"https://ma.tt/files/2015/04/81FYeTRjv4L._SL1500_-2-784x740.jpg\" alt=\"81FYeTRjv4L._SL1500_-2\" width=\"252\" height=\"238\" /></a>The battery goes <em>forever</em>, or as they claim 22 hours. You really forget to charge these things for a while and they still have plenty of juice. The volume and other controls actually work with the iPhone, and bluetooth calls have sounded great and people can actually hear me. Only downside is they have basically a proprietary connection for their 1/8th inch cable, so you have ta carry that around, but they charge with standard micro-USB. The only possible challenger I can think to these are the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00R45Z2WU/\">BeoPlay H8s</a>, which I haven&#8217;t tried yet.</p>\n<p><strong>tl; dr:</strong> If you want to exercise and get sweaty, get the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IYA2ZJW\">Powerbeats 2 in your favorite color</a>.

Peter is a web developer from the Land of the Danes. He is the creator of <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-pusher-aims-to-provide-pain-free-deployment-of-wordpress-themes-and-plugins-from-github\" target=\"_blank\">WP Pusher</a> and a huge travel addict, bringing his work along with him as he goes.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This article is based on a few ideas, thoughts and opinions I have about Git and WordPress. There is still no de-facto standard for how these things are dealt with in WordPress and I think it is our responsibility, as a community, to have discussions about them. These are my opinions and I would love to hear yours as well.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get right to it.</p>\n<h2>R-E-S-P-E-C-T</h2>\n<p>I have ranted about the subject of repository structure before and I have strong opinions about it. In my opinion there is one &#8211; and only one &#8211; way to structure Git repositories in a WordPress context. That one way is the one-package / one-repository approach. Let me explain why.</p>\n<p>While working on WP Pusher, I have seen many different approaches to structuring Git repositories. Two approaches are especially common, and, in my opinion, equally bad.</p>\n<p>The first one is Git-it-all, where everything, including WordPress core, plugins and themes are put under version control. The other one, and more common, is <code>wp-content</code>-under-version-control. I say that both of them are equally bad, because no matter what, you are going to have a lot of 3rd party code included in your Git repository, which quickly becomes a mess. Every time WordPress or one of your plugins or themes ships a new update, you will have to somehow deal with it within your version control system.</p>\n<p>The argument for having WordPress itself under version control is most often to lock down the version of the code. This seems a bit redundant to me, since WordPress is already developed using version control (SVN) and comes with a version number for each update. Why would you need to manage that yourself when it is already managed for you? Today, <a href=\"https://davidwinter.me/install-and-manage-wordpress-with-composer/\" target=\"_blank\">installing WordPress with Composer</a> is super easy and then you can control your version from the <code>composer.json</code> file. There are no excuses. Do not include WordPress in your Git repository.</p>\n<p>The second approach, <code>wp-content</code>-under-version-control, is often chosen as an easy way of deploying multiple plugins that might depend on each other. Still, I am not buying it. Having 5, 10, or even 20 Git repositories in your <code>wp-content</code> directory is really not an issue. Also, if your plugins depends on each other, take a look at must-use plugins.</p>\n<p>So here is the deal: <strong>You need to treat each of your packages (be it a plugin or a theme) with respect.</strong> You need to give each of them their own Git repository. They are their own entities and needs to be separated. Keeping them locked up together makes it impossible to share code across projects. It is the way Git is supposed to work, it is the way Composer is supposed to work, and it is even the way WordPress itself works.</p>\n<h2>To Ignore, Or Not To Ignore</h2>\n<p>Yes, that is the question and I do not have the answer. I am, of course, talking about the <code>.gitignore</code> file. The file that tells Git which files and directories to exclude from version control. Actually, the real question is: Should you precompile your dependencies before shipping your plugin, or not? (I will focus on PHP dependencies, since I do not know enough about front-end things.)</p>\n<p>In an ideal world, you would never ship something like Composer dependencies with your package. It would be up to the user to compile and fetch those dependencies that fit their specific environment. That is the whole point of dependency management tools. However, in WordPress, there is absolutely no sane way to handle these PHP dependencies. So if you are shipping a WordPress plugin that relies on 3rd party dependencies, I would say &#8220;ship it all&#8221;, even though it feels very wrong and awkward.</p>\n<p>This is <strong><em>bad</em></strong>, though, because what happens when Mailchimp for WordPress ships with one Composer package in v1.0.0 and WP Pusher ships with the same package but v2.0.0? Oh, the horror. The plugin that is loaded first will get to autoload its classes. The others will not (since it would result in a &#8220;class exists&#8221; fatal error). I probably do not need to explain why this is bad.</p>\n<p>As a WordPress developer, you can try to mitigate this by making sure that the functionality you rely on is actually available at runtime, but this is not optimal. However, I really think this is WordPress&#8217; responsibility. We cannot do PHP without using 3rd party code. That would be stupid. So as I said: No clear answer. I guess it just depends.</p>\n<h2>Exporting Repositories aka Zippin&#8217;</h2>\n<p>Recently, <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/2jzp6k/i_dont_need_your_tests_in_my_production/\" target=\"_blank\">someone on Reddit</a> proposed that people start to include a <code>.gitattributes</code> file in their repositories, containing export instructions for Git to use when archiving repositories (zipping them). Basically, by specifying it in your <code>.gitattributes</code> file, you can make Git ignore files that you only need for development.</p>\n<p>The Reddit thread was specifically targeting authors of packages distributed with Composer, but we can use this trick as well. If you exclude files from exports, they will not appear in the zip archives that you can download from GitHub or Bitbucket. This is nifty, especially if you use a tool like my <a href=\"https://wppusher.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Pusher</a> to move files from Git to WordPress, since it can drastically minimize the size of the archive files. No need to ship files such as assets, that are already compiled, and unit tests to end users.</p>\n<p>Here is the <code>.gitattributes</code> file for WP Pusher:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: xml; light: true; title: ; notranslate\">/features       export-ignore\n/apache-ci.conf export-ignore\n/behat.yml      export-ignore\n/circle.yml     export-ignore\n/composer.json  export-ignore\n/composer.lock  export-ignore</pre>\n<p>Before I knew about this trick, I manually deleted these files before shipping the plugin. Now it is done automatically.</p>\n<p>There you go. Just a few things I want you to think about and consider if you are a WordPress developer using Git. Thanks for reading along.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 08 Apr 2015 18:15:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Persistent XSS Vulnerability Discovered in WP Super Cache Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=41702\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"http://wptavern.com/persistent-xss-vulnerability-discovered-in-wp-super-cache-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2905:\"<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wp-super-cache.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41702]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wp-super-cache.png?resize=739%2C296\" alt=\"wp-super-cache\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41755\" /></a></p>\n<p>The security team at Sucuri has issued an <a href=\"http://blog.sucuri.net/2015/04/security-advisory-persistent-xss-in-wp-super-cache.html\" target=\"_blank\">advisory</a> for WordPress users who have the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Super Cache</a> plugin activated on their sites. The popular caching plugin contains a dangerous persistent XSS vulnerability that was promptly patched in its 1.4.4 release.</p>\n<p>Sucuri ranks the risk as &#8220;Dangerous&#8221; with a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAD:_Risk_assessment_model\" target=\"_blank\">DREAD</a> score of 8/10. Exploiting the vulnerability is relatively easy for an attacker intent on injecting a backdoor. Sucuri breaks down the technical details of the threat as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Using this vulnerability, an attacker using a carefully crafted query could insert malicious scripts to the plugin’s cached file listing page. As this page requires a valid nonce in order to be displayed, a successful exploitation would require the site’s administrator to have a look at that particular section, manually.</p>\n<p>When executed, the injected scripts could be used to perform a lot of other things like adding a new administrator account to the site, injecting backdoors by using WordPress theme edition tools, etc.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WP Super Cache is currently in use on more than a million WordPress sites, according to WordPress.org. If someone is looking to exploit the vulnerability in particular, there would be no shortage of sites to prey upon.</p>\n<p>In the recent <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/fbi-warns-of-isil-defacement-attacks-on-wordpress-sites\" target=\"_blank\">defacement attacks propagated by ISIL sympathists against WordPress sites</a>, hackers have been capitalizing on the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/zero-day-vulnerability-discovered-in-fancybox-for-wordpress-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">recent vulnerability found in the Fancy Box for WordPress plugin</a>. With just 100,000+ active installations, potentially vulnerably Fancy Box plugin users come in at a small fraction of those affected by the WP Super Cache security issue.</p>\n<p>Short of forcing an automatic plugin update on users, WordPress.org has no way of indicating that one particular plugin update may be more imperative than other routine updates. That&#8217;s why the best practice for site administrators is to keep tabs on your installations and set aside time to update extensions as part of your routine. If you&#8217;re using WP Super Cache, you are advised to update as soon as possible.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 08 Apr 2015 16:30:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"Matt: Giving Back to Open Source\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44891\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"http://ma.tt/2015/04/giving-back-to-open-source/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:372:\"<blockquote><p>Getting out of our ocean to explore the islands of open source is one of the best ways that we can expand our horizons, strengthen our skill sets, and build better relationships.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pippin on <a href=\"https://pippinsplugins.com/giving-back-for-the-future-of-open-source/\">why giving back to open source has made his company better</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 08 Apr 2015 04:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WPTavern: FBI Warns of ISIL Defacement Attacks on WordPress Sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=41707\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"http://wptavern.com/fbi-warns-of-isil-defacement-attacks-on-wordpress-sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4587:\"<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/security.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[41707]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/security.jpg?resize=1024%2C514\" alt=\"photo credit: Lock - (license)\" class=\"size-full wp-image-40187\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/58441544@N00/2660230441\">Lock</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>The FBI issued a public service announcement today, <a href=\"http://www.ic3.gov/media/2015/150407-1.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">warning concerning WordPress website attacks</a> being carried out by individuals sympathetic to the Islamic State in the Levant (ISIL) a.k.a. Islamic State of Iraq and al-Shams (ISIS). The perpetrators of these attacks are defacing sites across various platforms such as news organizations, businesses, government sites, and religious institutions.</p>\n<p>Last month the would-be terrorists gained infamy by <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/hackers-hijack-fancybox-plugin-to-deface-wordpress-sites-with-isis-propaganda\" target=\"_blank\">hijacking the Fancybox Plugin vulnerability in order to deface sites with ISIS propaganda</a>. This particular vulnerability allows malware (or any random script/content) to be added to the vulnerable site and was most recently identified as the entry point for the hackers who injected iframes with ISIS messages.</p>\n<p>A patch exists for the vulnerability and those affected can easily remove the plugin as an alternative. However, many WordPress users are either ignorant of the security issue or indifferent. The FBI&#8217;s announcement serves to warn users of the cost and inconvenience associated with this kind of attack:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Although the defacements demonstrate low-level hacking sophistication, they are disruptive and often costly in terms of lost business revenue and expenditures on technical services to repair infected computer systems.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The announcement cited multiple plugin vulnerabilities as a security risk to WordPress users but did not identify the plugins for which patches are currently available. Technical details of the brief are limited to a generalized list of consequences should a vulnerable site get hacked:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities could result in an attacker gaining unauthorized access, bypassing security restrictions, injecting scripts, and stealing cookies from computer systems or network servers. An attacker could install malicious software; manipulate data; or create new accounts with full user privileges for future Web site exploitation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since these are low level hackers exploiting the most basic types of vulnerabilities, they are not targeting specific sites but rather knocking down any open door they can find. The announcement notes that all of the victims of the defacements share common WordPress plugin vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>The FBI does not believe that these attacks are actually coming from members of ISIL but instead are coming from hackers using the organization&#8217;s name as a vehicle for greater exposure.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The FBI assesses that the perpetrators are not members of the ISIL terrorist organization. These individuals are hackers using relatively unsophisticated methods to exploit technical vulnerabilities and are utilizing the ISIL name to gain more notoriety than the underlying attack would have otherwise garnered.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The announcement concludes with a list of general resources for hardening WordPress and identifying vulnerabilities, but the recommendations are vague and non-specific. The best thing that you can do to keep your site safe from these continuing attacks is to make sure you are running the latest version of WordPress. Log in to your sites and update all of your themes and plugins. If you&#8217;re using any commercial plugins or themes, make sure to check for updates in case you are not automatically notified.</p>\n<p>All of the vulnerabilities referenced in the FBI warning already have patches, and all you need to do is update your plugins.

It&#8217;s a method humans have used for centuries and is easier to reference compared to audio and video. Dunn offers advice to WordPress coaches and trainers looking at the data from an instructor&#8217;s point of view:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you are looking at this from an instructor’s point of view, I bet you can come up with a lot of other thoughts and maybe even some deep insights. But the fact is, while these numbers can tell us a lot of what the majority of people prefer, as teachers of WordPress, we still need to find the markets that are not being filled, and the offerings that are not over-saturated, no matter what the numbers tell us.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To see a visual representation of the results and to read Dunn&#8217;s thoughts on his findings, check out his <a title=\"http://bobwp.com/how-do-you-learn-wordpress-the-survey-results-infographic/\" href=\"http://bobwp.com/how-do-you-learn-wordpress-the-survey-results-infographic/\">latest blog post</a>.
